# Usage

- using pre-trained model

```sql
-- 1. create a tokenizer
SELECT create_tokenizer('tokenizer1', $$
model = "llmlingua2"
$$);

-- 2. tokenize using defined tokenizer
SELECT tokenize('PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It has over 15 years of active development.', 'tokenizer1');

-- For setting up a table
UPDATE table_name SET target_column_name = tokenize(source_column_name, 'tokenizer1');
```

- using custom model

```sql
-- 1. setup the document table
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    passage TEXT,
    embedding INT[]
);

-- 2. create a text analyzer to generate tokens that can be used to train the model
SELECT create_text_analyzer('text_analyzer1', $$
pre_tokenizer = "unicode_segmentation"  # split texts according to the Unicode Standard Annex #29
[[character_filters]]
to_lowercase = {}                       # convert all characters to lowercase
[[character_filters]]
unicode_normalization = "nfkd"          # normalize the text to Unicode Normalization Form KD
[[token_filters]]
skip_non_alphanumeric = {}              # skip tokens that all characters are not alphanumeric
[[token_filters]]
stopwords = "nltk_english"              # remove stopwords using the nltk dictionary
[[token_filters]]
stemmer = "english_porter2"             # stem tokens using the English Porter2 stemmer
$$);

-- 3. create a model to generate embeddings from original passage
-- It'll train a model from passage column and store the embeddings in the embedding column
SELECT create_custom_model_tokenizer_and_trigger(
    tokenizer_name => 'tokenizer1',
    model_name => 'model1',
    text_analyzer_name => 'text_analyzer1',
    table_name => 'documents',
    source_column => 'passage',
    target_column => 'embedding'
);

-- 4. now you can insert some data and embeddings will be generated automatically
INSERT INTO documents (passage) VALUES 
('PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It has over 15 years of active development.'),
('Full-text search is a technique for searching in plain-text documents or textual database fields. PostgreSQL supports this with tsvector.'),
('BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query.'),
('PostgreSQL provides many advanced features like full-text search, window functions, and more.'),
('Search and ranking in databases are important in building effective information retrieval systems.'),
('The BM25 ranking algorithm is derived from the probabilistic retrieval framework.'),
('Full-text search indexes documents to allow fast text queries. PostgreSQL supports this through its GIN and GiST indexes.'),
('The PostgreSQL community is active and regularly improves the database system.'),
('Relational databases such as PostgreSQL can handle both structured and unstructured data.'),
('Effective search ranking algorithms, such as BM25, improve search results by understanding relevance.');

## Tokenizer configuration

The tokenizer is mainly composed by 2 parts, `text analyzer` and `model`. `text analyzer` is used to parse the text and generate token arrays, which has similar functionality as `tsvector`. While `model` is used to generate token embeddings(token id array, can be casted to `bm25vector`), which is used for similarity search.

### Text Analyzer

`text analyzer` has 3 main components, `character filters`, `pre tokenizer`, `token filters`.

- character filter: It is used to filter out some characters before tokenization. e.g. `to_lowercase`, `unicode_normalization`.
- pre tokenizer: It is used to split the text into tokens. e.g. `unicode segmentation` will split texts according to the [`Unicode Standard Annex #29`](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/)
- token filter: It is used to filter out some tokens after tokenization. e.g. `stopwords`, `stemmer`.

Details of `text analyzer` configuration can be found in the [text analyzer](05-text-analyzer.md) document.

### Model

`model` has 2 main types, `pre-trained`, `custom`.
- `pre-trained` models have pre-trained vocab lists and some pre-defined tokenization rules. e.g. [`bert_base_uncased`](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased), [`wiki_tocken`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/iohadrubin/wikitext-103-raw-v1).
- `custom` models will maintain their own vocab mapping. You can build a custom model based on your own corpus easily.

> Note that some models may have similar processes as `text analyzer`, so you can skip the `text analyzer` configuration for these models.

Details of `model` configuration can be found in the [model](06-model.md) document.

### Config Examples

We utilize the `TOML` format to define the configurations. Here are some examples:

- define a text analyzer and a model first, then create a tokenizer

```sql
-- define a text analyzer
SELECT create_text_analyzer('text_analyzer1', $$
pre_tokenizer = "unicode_segmentation"
$$);

-- define a model, or skip this step if you want to use builtin models
SELECT create_huggingface_model('model1', $$
...
$$);

-- create a tokenizer
SELECT create_tokenizer('tokenizer1', $$
text_analyzer = "text_analyzer1"  -- optional, you can skip this if your model can tokenize text directly
model = "model1"
$$);
```

- inline text analyzer

```sql
-- define a model
SELECT create_huggingface_model('model1', $$
...
$$);

-- create a tokenizer
SELECT create_tokenizer('tokenizer1', $$
-- inlined text analyzer configuration
pre_tokenizer = "unicode_segmentation"
[[character_filters]]
to_lowercase = {}
[[token_filters]]
stopwords = "nltk_english"
-- model configuration
model = "model1"
$$);
```
