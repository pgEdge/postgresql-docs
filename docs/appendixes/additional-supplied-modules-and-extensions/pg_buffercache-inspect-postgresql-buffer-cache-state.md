## pg_buffercache — inspect PostgreSQL buffer cache state


 The `pg_buffercache` module provides a means for examining what's happening in the shared buffer cache in real time. It also offers a low-level way to evict data from it, for testing purposes.


 This module provides the `pg_buffercache_pages()` function (wrapped in the `pg_buffercache` view), the `pg_buffercache_os_pages()` function (wrapped in the `pg_buffercache_os_pages` and `pg_buffercache_numa` views), the `pg_buffercache_summary()` function, the `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` function, the `pg_buffercache_evict()` function, the `pg_buffercache_evict_relation()` function, the `pg_buffercache_evict_all()` function, the `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty()` function, the `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_relation()` function and the `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_all()` function.


 The `pg_buffercache_pages()` function returns a set of records, each row describing the state of one shared buffer entry. The `pg_buffercache` view wraps the function for convenient use.


 The `pg_buffercache_os_pages()` function provides OS pages mappings for shared buffer entries. When its argument is `true`, it also provides NUMA node mappings for shared buffer entries (this information is not part of `pg_buffercache_pages()` itself, as it is much slower to retrieve). The `pg_buffercache_os_pages` and `pg_buffercache_numa` views wrap the function for convenient use, with its argument set to `false` and `true` respectively.


 The `pg_buffercache_summary()` function returns a single row summarizing the state of the shared buffer cache.


 The `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` function returns a set of records, each row describing the number of buffers with a given usage count.


 By default, use of the above functions is restricted to superusers and roles with privileges of the `pg_monitor` role. Access may be granted to others using `GRANT`.


 The `pg_buffercache_evict()` function allows a block to be evicted from the buffer pool given a buffer identifier. Use of this function is restricted to superusers only.


 The `pg_buffercache_evict_relation()` function allows all unpinned shared buffers in the relation to be evicted from the buffer pool given a relation identifier. Use of this function is restricted to superusers only.


 The `pg_buffercache_evict_all()` function allows all unpinned shared buffers to be evicted in the buffer pool. Use of this function is restricted to superusers only.


 The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty()` function allows a block to be marked as dirty in the buffer pool given a buffer identifier. Use of this function is restricted to superusers only.


 The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_relation()` function allows all unpinned shared buffers in the relation to be marked as dirty in the buffer pool given a relation identifier. Use of this function is restricted to superusers only.


 The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_all()` function allows all unpinned shared buffers to be marked as dirty in the buffer pool. Use of this function is restricted to superusers only.

 There is one row for each buffer in the shared cache. Unused buffers are shown with all fields null except `bufferid`. Shared system catalogs are shown as belonging to database zero.


 Because the cache is shared by all the databases, there will normally be pages from relations not belonging to the current database. This means that there may not be matching join rows in `pg_class` for some rows, or that there could even be incorrect joins. If you are trying to join against `pg_class`, it's a good idea to restrict the join to rows having `reldatabase` equal to the current database's OID or zero.


 Since buffer manager locks are not taken to copy the buffer state data that the view will display, accessing `pg_buffercache` view has less impact on normal buffer activity but it doesn't provide a consistent set of results across all buffers. However, we ensure that the information of each buffer is self-consistent.

 As NUMA node ID inquiry for each page requires memory pages to be paged-in, the first execution of this function can take a noticeable amount of time. In all the cases (first execution or not), retrieving this information is costly and querying the view at a high frequency is not recommended.


!!! warning

    When determining the NUMA node, the view touches all memory pages for the shared memory segment. This will force allocation of the shared memory, if it wasn't allocated already, and the memory may get allocated in a single NUMA node (depending on system configuration).

 The `pg_buffercache_summary()` function returns a single row summarizing the state of all shared buffers. Similar and more detailed information is provided by the `pg_buffercache` view, but `pg_buffercache_summary()` is significantly cheaper.


 Like the `pg_buffercache` view, `pg_buffercache_summary()` does not acquire buffer manager locks. Therefore concurrent activity can lead to minor inaccuracies in the result.

 The `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` function returns a set of rows summarizing the states of all shared buffers, aggregated over the possible usage count values. Similar and more detailed information is provided by the `pg_buffercache` view, but `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` is significantly cheaper.

  <a id="pgbuffercache-pg-buffercache-evict"></a>

### The `pg_buffercache_evict()` Function


 The `pg_buffercache_evict()` function takes a buffer identifier, as shown in the `bufferid` column of the `pg_buffercache` view. It returns information about whether the buffer was evicted and flushed. The `buffer_evicted` column is true on success, and false if the buffer wasn't valid, if it couldn't be evicted because it was pinned, or if it became dirty again after an attempt to write it out. The `buffer_flushed` column is true if the buffer was flushed. This does not necessarily mean that buffer was flushed by us, it might be flushed by someone else. The result is immediately out of date upon return, as the buffer might become valid again at any time due to concurrent activity. The function is intended for developer testing only.
  <a id="pgbuffercache-pg-buffercache-evict-relation"></a>

### The `pg_buffercache_evict_relation()` Function


 The `pg_buffercache_evict_relation()` function is very similar to the `pg_buffercache_evict()` function. The difference is that the `pg_buffercache_evict_relation()` takes a relation identifier instead of buffer identifier. It tries to evict all buffers for all forks in that relation. It returns the number of evicted buffers, flushed buffers and the number of buffers that could not be evicted. Flushed buffers haven't necessarily been flushed by us, they might have been flushed by someone else. The result is immediately out of date upon return, as buffers might immediately be read back in due to concurrent activity. The function is intended for developer testing only.
  <a id="pgbuffercache-pg-buffercache-evict-all"></a>

### The `pg_buffercache_evict_all()` Function


 The `pg_buffercache_evict_all()` function is very similar to the `pg_buffercache_evict()` function. The difference is, the `pg_buffercache_evict_all()` function does not take an argument; instead it tries to evict all buffers in the buffer pool. It returns the number of evicted buffers, flushed buffers and the number of buffers that could not be evicted. Flushed buffers haven't necessarily been flushed by us, they might have been flushed by someone else. The result is immediately out of date upon return, as buffers might immediately be read back in due to concurrent activity. The function is intended for developer testing only.
  <a id="pgbuffercache-pg-buffercache-mark-dirty"></a>

### The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty()` Function


 The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty()` function takes a buffer identifier, as shown in the `bufferid` column of the `pg_buffercache` view. It returns information about whether the buffer was marked as dirty. The `buffer_dirtied` column is true on success, and false if the buffer was already dirty if the buffer was not valid or if it could not be marked as dirty because it was pinned. The `buffer_already_dirty` column is true if the buffer couldn't be marked as dirty because it was already dirty. The result is immediately out of date upon return, as the buffer might become valid again at any time due to concurrent activity. The function is intended for developer testing only.

### The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_relation()` Function


 The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_relation()` function is very similar to the `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty()` function. The difference is that the `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_relation()` function takes a relation identifier instead of buffer identifier. It tries to mark all buffers dirty for all forks in that relation. It returns the number of buffers marked as dirty, the number of buffers already dirty and the number of buffers skipped because already pinned or invalid. The result is immediately out of date upon return, as the buffer might become valid again at any time due to concurrent activity. The function is intended for developer testing only.
  <a id="pgbuffercache-pg-buffercache-mark-dirty-all"></a>

### The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_all()` Function


 The `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_all()` function is very similar to the `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty()` function. The difference is that the `pg_buffercache_mark_dirty_all()` tries to mark all buffers dirty in the buffer pool. It returns the number of buffers marked as dirty, the number of buffers already dirty and the number of buffers skipped because already pinned or invalid. The result is immediately out of date upon return, as the buffer might become valid again at any time due to concurrent activity. The function is intended for developer testing only.
