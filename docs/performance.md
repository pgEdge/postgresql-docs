# Performance

## Tuning

Use a tool like [PgTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) to set initial values for Postgres server parameters. For instance, `shared_buffers` should typically be 25% of the server’s memory. You can find the config file with:

```sql
SHOW config_file;
```

And check individual settings with:

```sql
SHOW shared_buffers;
```

Be sure to restart Postgres for changes to take effect.

## Loading

Use `COPY` for bulk loading data ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/loading/example.py)).

```sql
COPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY);
```

Add any indexes *after* loading the initial data for best performance.

## Indexing

See index build time for [HNSW](ivfflat.md#index-build-time) and [IVFFlat](#index-build-time-1).

In production environments, create indexes concurrently to avoid blocking writes.

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ...
```

## Querying

Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to debug performance.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

### Exact Search

To speed up queries without an index, increase `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`.

```sql
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
```

If vectors are normalized to length 1 (like [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use)), use inner product for best performance.

```tsql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <#> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

### Approximate Search

To speed up queries with an IVFFlat index, increase the number of inverted lists (at the expense of recall).

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 1000);
```

## Vacuuming

Vacuuming can take a while for HNSW indexes. Speed it up by reindexing first.

```sql
REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_name;
VACUUM table_name;
```
