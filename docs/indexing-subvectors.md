# Indexing Subvectors

*Added in 0.7.0*

Use expression indexing to index subvectors

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw ((subvector(embedding, 1, 3)::vector(3)) vector_cosine_ops);
```

Get the nearest neighbors by cosine distance

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY subvector(embedding, 1, 3)::vector(3) <=> subvector('[1,2,3,4,5]'::vector, 1, 3) LIMIT 5;
```

Re-rank by the full vectors for better recall

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY subvector(embedding, 1, 3)::vector(3) <=> subvector('[1,2,3,4,5]'::vector, 1, 3) LIMIT 20
) ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1,2,3,4,5]' LIMIT 5;
```
