## Installing, Upgrading Tiger Geocoder, and loading data


Extras like Tiger geocoder may not be packaged in your PostGIS distribution. If you are missing the tiger geocoder extension or want a newer version than what your install comes with, then use the `share/extension/postgis_tiger_geocoder.*` files from the packages in [Windows Unreleased Versions](http://postgis.net/windows_downloads/) section for your version of PostgreSQL. Although these packages are for windows, the postgis_tiger_geocoder extension files will work on any OS since the extension is an SQL/plpgsql only extension.

## Tiger Geocoder Enabling your PostGIS database


1. These directions assume your PostgreSQL installation already has the postgis_tiger_geocoder extension installed.
2. Connect to your database via psql or pgAdmin or some other tool and run the following SQL commands. Note that if you are installing in a database that already has postgis, you don't need to do the first step. If you have `fuzzystrmatch` extension already installed, you don't need to do the second step either.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder;
--this one is optional if you want to use the rules based standardizer (pagc_normalize_address)
CREATE EXTENSION address_standardizer;
```

   If you already have postgis_tiger_geocoder extension installed, and just want to update to the latest run:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION postgis UPDATE;
ALTER EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder UPDATE;
```

   If you made custom entries or changes to `tiger.loader_platform` and `tiger.loader_variables` you may need to update these.
3. To confirm your install is working correctly, run this sql in your database:

```sql
SELECT na.address, na.streetname,na.streettypeabbrev, na.zip
	FROM normalize_address('1 Devonshire Place, Boston, MA 02109') AS na;
```

   Which should output

```
 address | streetname | streettypeabbrev |  zip
---------+------------+------------------+-------
	   1 | Devonshire | Pl               | 02109
```
4. Create a new record in `tiger.loader_platform` table with the paths of your executables and server.

   So for example to create a profile called debbie that follows <code>sh</code> convention. You would do:

```sql
INSERT INTO tiger.loader_platform(os, declare_sect, pgbin, wget, unzip_command, psql, path_sep,
		   loader, environ_set_command, county_process_command)
SELECT 'debbie', declare_sect, pgbin, wget, unzip_command, psql, path_sep,
	   loader, environ_set_command, county_process_command
  FROM tiger.loader_platform
  WHERE os = 'sh';
```

   And then edit the paths in the *declare_sect* column to those that fit Debbie's pg, unzip,shp2pgsql, psql, etc path locations.

   If you don't edit this `loader_platform` table, it will just contain common case locations of items and you'll have to edit the generated script after the script is generated.
5. As of PostGIS 2.4.1 the Zip code-5 digit tabulation area `zcta5` load step was revised to load current zcta5 data and is part of the [Loader_Generate_Nation_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Nation_Script) when enabled. It is turned off by default because it takes quite a bit of time to load (20 to 60 minutes), takes up quite a bit of disk space, and is not used that often.

   To enable it, do the following:

```sql
UPDATE tiger.loader_lookuptables SET load = true WHERE table_name = 'zcta520';
```

    If present the [Geocode](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Geocode) function can use it if a boundary filter is added to limit to just zips in that boundary. The [Reverse_Geocode](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Reverse_Geocode) function uses it if the returned address is missing a zip, which often happens with highway reverse geocoding.
6. Create a folder called `gisdata` on root of server or your local pc if you have a fast network connection to the server. This folder is where the tiger files will be downloaded to and processed. If you are not happy with having the folder on the root of the server, or simply want to change to a different folder for staging, then edit the field `staging_fold` in the `tiger.loader_variables` table.
7. Create a folder called temp in the `gisdata` folder or wherever you designated the `staging_fold` to be. This will be the folder where the loader extracts the downloaded tiger data.
8. Then run the [Loader_Generate_Nation_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Nation_Script) SQL function make sure to use the name of your custom profile and copy the script to a .sh or .bat file. So for example to build the nation load:

```
psql -c "SELECT Loader_Generate_Nation_Script('debbie')" -d geocoder -tA > /gisdata/nation_script_load.sh
```
9. Run the generated nation load commandline scripts.

```
cd /gisdata
sh nation_script_load.sh
```
10. After you are done running the nation script, you should have three tables in your <code>tiger_data</code> schema and they should be filled with data. Confirm you do by doing the following queries from psql or pgAdmin

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM tiger_data.county_all;
```

```
 count
-------
  3235
(1 row)
```

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM tiger_data.state_all;
```

```

 count
-------
    56
(1 row)
```

    This will only have data if you marked zcta5 to be loaded

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM tiger_data.zcta5_all;
```

```

 count
-------
  33933
(1 row)
```
11. By default the tables corresponding to `bg`, `tract`, `tabblock20` are not loaded. These tables are not used by the geocoder but are used by folks for population statistics. If you wish to load them as part of your state loads, run the following statement to enable them.

```sql
UPDATE tiger.loader_lookuptables SET load = true WHERE load = false AND lookup_name IN('tract', 'bg', 'tabblock20');
```

    Alternatively you can load just these tables after loading state data using the [Loader_Generate_Census_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Census_Script)
12. For each state you want to load data for, generate a state script [Loader_Generate_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Script).

!!! warning

    DO NOT Generate the state script until you have already loaded the nation data, because the state script utilizes county list loaded by nation script.
13.

```
psql -c "SELECT Loader_Generate_Script(ARRAY['MA'], 'debbie')" -d geocoder -tA > /gisdata/ma_load.sh
```
14. Run the generated commandline scripts.

```
cd /gisdata
sh ma_load.sh
```
15. After you are done loading all data or at a stopping point, it's a good idea to analyze all the tiger tables to update the stats (include inherited stats)

```sql
SELECT install_missing_indexes();
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.addr;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.edges;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.faces;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.featnames;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.place;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.cousub;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.county;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.state;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.zcta5;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.zip_lookup_base;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.zip_state;
vacuum (analyze, verbose) tiger.zip_state_loc;
```

## Using Address Standardizer Extension with Tiger geocoder


One of the many complaints of folks is the address normalizer function [Normalize_Address](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Normalize_Address) function that normalizes an address for prepping before geocoding. The normalizer is far from perfect and trying to patch its imperfectness takes a vast amount of resources. As such we have integrated with another project that has a much better address standardizer engine. To use this new address_standardizer, you compile the extension as described in [Installing and Using the address standardizer](installing-and-using-the-address-standardizer.md#installing_pagc_address_standardizer) and install as an extension in your database.


Once you install this extension in the same database as you have installed <code>postgis_tiger_geocoder</code>, then the [Pagc_Normalize_Address](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Pagc_Normalize_Address) can be used instead of [Normalize_Address](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Normalize_Address). This extension is tiger agnostic, so can be used with other data sources such as international addresses. The tiger geocoder extension does come packaged with its own custom versions of [rulestab](../postgis-extras/address-standardizer.md#rulestab) ( <code>tiger.pagc_rules</code>) , [gaztab](../postgis-extras/address-standardizer.md#gaztab) (<code>tiger.pagc_gaz</code>), and [lextab](../postgis-extras/address-standardizer.md#lextab) (<code>tiger.pagc_lex</code>). These you can add and update to improve your standardizing experience for your own needs.

## Required tools for tiger data loading


The load process downloads data from the census website for the respective nation files, states requested, extracts the files, and then loads each state into its own separate set of state tables. Each state table inherits from the tables defined in `tiger` schema so that its sufficient to just query those tables to access all the data and drop a set of state tables at any time using the [Drop_State_Tables_Generate_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Drop_State_Tables_Generate_Script) if you need to reload a state or just don't need a state anymore.


In order to be able to load data you'll need the following tools:


- A tool to unzip the zip files from census website.

  For Unix like systems: `unzip` executable which is usually already installed on most Unix like platforms.

  For Windows, 7-zip which is a free compress/uncompress tool you can download from [http://www.7-zip.org/](http://www.7-zip.org/)
- `shp2pgsql` commandline which is installed by default when you install PostGIS.
- `wget` which is a web grabber tool usually installed on most Unix/Linux systems.

  If you are on windows, you can get pre-compiled binaries from [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm)


If you are upgrading from tiger_2010, you'll need to first generate and run [Drop_Nation_Tables_Generate_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Drop_Nation_Tables_Generate_Script). Before you load any state data, you need to load the nation wide data which you do with [Loader_Generate_Nation_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Nation_Script). Which will generate a loader script for you. [Loader_Generate_Nation_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Nation_Script) is a one-time step that should be done for upgrading (from a prior year tiger census data) and for new installs.


To load state data refer to [Loader_Generate_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Script) to generate a data load script for your platform for the states you desire. Note that you can install these piecemeal. You don't have to load all the states you want all at once. You can load them as you need them.


After the states you desire have been loaded, make sure to run the:

```sql
SELECT install_missing_indexes();
```
 as described in [Install_Missing_Indexes](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Install_Missing_Indexes).


To test that things are working as they should, try to run a geocode on an address in your state using [Geocode](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Geocode)

## Upgrading your Tiger Geocoder Install and Data


First upgrade your postgis_tiger_geocoder extension as follows:


```sql
ALTER EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder UPDATE;
```


Next drop all nation tables and load up the new ones. Generate a drop script with this SQL statement as detailed in [Drop_Nation_Tables_Generate_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Drop_Nation_Tables_Generate_Script)


```sql
SELECT drop_nation_tables_generate_script();
```


Run the generated drop SQL statements.


Generate a nation load script with this SELECT statement as detailed in [Loader_Generate_Nation_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Loader_Generate_Nation_Script)


**For windows**


```sql
SELECT loader_generate_nation_script('windows');
```


**For unix/linux**


```sql
SELECT loader_generate_nation_script('sh');
```


Refer to [Tiger Geocoder Enabling your PostGIS database](#install_tiger_geocoder_extension) for instructions on how to run the generate script. This only needs to be done once.


!!! note

    You can have a mix of different year state tables and can upgrade each state separately. Before you upgrade a state you first need to drop the prior year state tables for that state using [Drop_State_Tables_Generate_Script](../postgis-extras/tiger-geocoder.md#Drop_State_Tables_Generate_Script).
