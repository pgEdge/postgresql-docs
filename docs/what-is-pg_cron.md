# What is pg_cron?

pg_cron is a simple cron-based job scheduler for PostgreSQL (10 or higher) that runs inside the database as an extension. It uses the same syntax as regular cron, but it allows you to schedule PostgreSQL commands directly from the database. You can also use '[1-59] seconds' to schedule a job based on an interval.

pg_cron also allows you using '$' to indicate last day of the month.

```sql
-- Delete old data on Saturday at 3:30am (GMT)
SELECT cron.schedule('30 3 * * 6', $$DELETE FROM events WHERE event_time < now() - interval '1 week'$$);
 schedule
----------
       42

-- Vacuum every day at 10:00am (GMT)
SELECT cron.schedule('nightly-vacuum', '0 10 * * *', 'VACUUM');
 schedule
----------
       43

-- Change to vacuum at 3:00am (GMT)
SELECT cron.schedule('nightly-vacuum', '0 3 * * *', 'VACUUM');
 schedule
----------
       43

-- Stop scheduling jobs
SELECT cron.unschedule('nightly-vacuum' );
 unschedule 
------------
 t

SELECT cron.unschedule(42);
 unschedule
------------
          t

-- Vacuum every Sunday at 4:00am (GMT) in a database other than the one pg_cron is installed in
SELECT cron.schedule_in_database('weekly-vacuum', '0 4 * * 0', 'VACUUM', 'some_other_database');
 schedule
----------
       44

-- Call a stored procedure every 5 seconds
SELECT cron.schedule('process-updates', '5 seconds', 'CALL process_updates()');

-- Process payroll at 12:00 of the last day of each month
SELECT cron.schedule('process-payroll', '0 12 $ * *', 'CALL process_payroll()');
```

pg_cron can run multiple jobs in parallel, but it runs at most one instance of a job at a time. If a second run is supposed to start before the first one finishes, then the second run is queued and started as soon as the first run completes.

The schedule uses the standard cron syntax, in which * means "run every time period", and a specific number means "but only at this time":

```
 ┌───────────── min (0 - 59)
 │ ┌────────────── hour (0 - 23)
 │ │ ┌─────────────── day of month (1 - 31) or last day of the month ($)
 │ │ │ ┌──────────────── month (1 - 12)
 │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────── day of week (0 - 6) (0 to 6 are Sunday to
 │ │ │ │ │                  Saturday, or use names; 7 is also Sunday)
 │ │ │ │ │
 │ │ │ │ │
 * * * * *
```

An easy way to create a cron schedule is: [crontab.guru](http://crontab.guru/).

The code in pg_cron that handles parsing and scheduling comes directly from the cron source code by Paul Vixie, hence the same options are supported.
