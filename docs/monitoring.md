# Monitoring

Monitor performance with [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) (be sure to add it to `shared_preload_libraries`).

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
```

Get the most time-consuming queries with:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, ROUND((total_plan_time + total_exec_time) / calls) AS avg_time_ms,
    ROUND((total_plan_time + total_exec_time) / 60000) AS total_time_min
    FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_plan_time + total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 20;
```

Note: Replace `total_plan_time + total_exec_time` with `total_time` for Postgres < 13

Monitor recall by comparing results from approximate search with exact search.

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL enable_indexscan = off; -- use exact search
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```
