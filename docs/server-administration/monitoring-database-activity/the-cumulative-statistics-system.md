## The Cumulative Statistics System


 PostgreSQL's *cumulative statistics system* supports collection and reporting of information about server activity. Presently, accesses to tables and indexes in both disk-block and individual-row terms are counted. The total number of rows in each table, and information about vacuum and analyze actions for each table are also counted. If enabled, calls to user-defined functions and the total time spent in each one are counted as well.


 PostgreSQL also supports reporting dynamic information about exactly what is going on in the system right now, such as the exact command currently being executed by other server processes, and which other connections exist in the system. This facility is independent of the cumulative statistics system.

### Statistics Collection Configuration


 Since collection of statistics adds some overhead to query execution, the system can be configured to collect or not collect information. This is controlled by configuration parameters that are normally set in `postgresql.conf`. (See [Server Configuration](../server-configuration/index.md#runtime-config) for details about setting configuration parameters.)


 The parameter [track_activities](../server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-track-activities) enables monitoring of the current command being executed by any server process.


 The parameter [track_counts](../server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-track-counts) controls whether cumulative statistics are collected about table and index accesses.


 The parameter [track_functions](../server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-track-functions) enables tracking of usage of user-defined functions.


 The parameter [track_io_timing](../server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-track-io-timing) enables monitoring of block read, write, extend, and fsync times.


 The parameter [track_wal_io_timing](../server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-track-wal-io-timing) enables monitoring of WAL write and fsync times.


 Normally these parameters are set in `postgresql.conf` so that they apply to all server processes, but it is possible to turn them on or off in individual sessions using the [sql-set](../../reference/sql-commands/set.md#sql-set) command. (To prevent ordinary users from hiding their activity from the administrator, only superusers are allowed to change these parameters with `SET`.)


 Cumulative statistics are collected in shared memory. Every PostgreSQL process collects statistics locally, then updates the shared data at appropriate intervals. When a server, including a physical replica, shuts down cleanly, a permanent copy of the statistics data is stored in the `pg_stat` subdirectory, so that statistics can be retained across server restarts. In contrast, when starting from an unclean shutdown (e.g., after an immediate shutdown, a server crash, starting from a base backup, and point-in-time recovery), all statistics counters are reset.

### Viewing Statistics


 Several predefined views, listed in [Dynamic Statistics Views](#monitoring-stats-dynamic-views-table), are available to show the current state of the system. There are also several other views, listed in [Collected Statistics Views](#monitoring-stats-views-table), available to show the accumulated statistics. Alternatively, one can build custom views using the underlying cumulative statistics functions, as discussed in [Statistics Functions](#monitoring-stats-functions).


 When using the cumulative statistics views and functions to monitor collected data, it is important to realize that the information does not update instantaneously. Each individual server process flushes out accumulated statistics to shared memory just before going idle, but not more frequently than once per `PGSTAT_MIN_INTERVAL` milliseconds (1 second unless altered while building the server); so a query or transaction still in progress does not affect the displayed totals and the displayed information lags behind actual activity. However, current-query information collected by `track_activities` is always up-to-date.


 Another important point is that when a server process is asked to display any of the accumulated statistics, accessed values are cached until the end of its current transaction in the default configuration. So the statistics will show static information as long as you continue the current transaction. Similarly, information about the current queries of all sessions is collected when any such information is first requested within a transaction, and the same information will be displayed throughout the transaction. This is a feature, not a bug, because it allows you to perform several queries on the statistics and correlate the results without worrying that the numbers are changing underneath you. When analyzing statistics interactively, or with expensive queries, the time delta between accesses to individual statistics can lead to significant skew in the cached statistics. To minimize skew, `stats_fetch_consistency` can be set to `snapshot`, at the price of increased memory usage for caching not-needed statistics data. Conversely, if it's known that statistics are only accessed once, caching accessed statistics is unnecessary and can be avoided by setting `stats_fetch_consistency` to `none`. You can invoke `pg_stat_clear_snapshot`() to discard the current transaction's statistics snapshot or cached values (if any). The next use of statistical information will (when in snapshot mode) cause a new snapshot to be built or (when in cache mode) accessed statistics to be cached.


 A transaction can also see its own statistics (not yet flushed out to the shared memory statistics) in the views `pg_stat_xact_all_tables`, `pg_stat_xact_sys_tables`, `pg_stat_xact_user_tables`, and `pg_stat_xact_user_functions`. These numbers do not act as stated above; instead they update continuously throughout the transaction.


 Some of the information in the dynamic statistics views shown in [Dynamic Statistics Views](#monitoring-stats-dynamic-views-table) is security restricted. Ordinary users can only see all the information about their own sessions (sessions belonging to a role that they are a member of). In rows about other sessions, many columns will be null. Note, however, that the existence of a session and its general properties such as its sessions user and database are visible to all users. Superusers and roles with privileges of built-in role `pg_read_all_stats` (see also [Predefined Roles](../database-roles/predefined-roles.md#predefined-roles)) can see all the information about all sessions.

 The per-index statistics are particularly useful to determine which indexes are being used and how effective they are.


 The `pg_stat_io` and `pg_statio_` set of views are useful for determining the effectiveness of the buffer cache. They can be used to calculate a cache hit ratio. Note that while PostgreSQL's I/O statistics capture most instances in which the kernel was invoked in order to perform I/O, they do not differentiate between data which had to be fetched from disk and that which already resided in the kernel page cache. Users are advised to use the PostgreSQL statistics views in combination with operating system utilities for a more complete picture of their database's I/O performance.

!!! note

    The `wait_event` and `state` columns are independent. If a backend is in the `active` state, it may or may not be `waiting` on some event. If the state is `active` and `wait_event` is non-null, it means that a query is being executed, but is being blocked somewhere in the system.
 <a id="wait-event-table"></a>

**Table: Wait Event Types**

| Wait Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Activity` | The server process is idle. This event type indicates a process waiting for activity in its main processing loop. `wait_event` will identify the specific wait point; see [Wait Events of Type `Activity`](#wait-event-activity-table). |
| `BufferPin` | The server process is waiting for exclusive access to a data buffer. Buffer pin waits can be protracted if another process holds an open cursor that last read data from the buffer in question. See [Wait Events of Type `BufferPin`](#wait-event-bufferpin-table). |
| `Client` | The server process is waiting for activity on a socket connected to a user application. Thus, the server expects something to happen that is independent of its internal processes. `wait_event` will identify the specific wait point; see [Wait Events of Type `Client`](#wait-event-client-table). |
| `Extension` | The server process is waiting for some condition defined by an extension module. See [Wait Events of Type `Extension`](#wait-event-extension-table). |
| `IO` | The server process is waiting for an I/O operation to complete. `wait_event` will identify the specific wait point; see [Wait Events of Type `IO`](#wait-event-io-table). |
| `IPC` | The server process is waiting for some interaction with another server process. `wait_event` will identify the specific wait point; see [Wait Events of Type `IPC`](#wait-event-ipc-table). |
| `Lock` | The server process is waiting for a heavyweight lock. Heavyweight locks, also known as lock manager locks or simply locks, primarily protect SQL-visible objects such as tables. However, they are also used to ensure mutual exclusion for certain internal operations such as relation extension. `wait_event` will identify the type of lock awaited; see [Wait Events of Type `Lock`](#wait-event-lock-table). |
| `LWLock` | The server process is waiting for a lightweight lock. Most such locks protect a particular data structure in shared memory. `wait_event` will contain a name identifying the purpose of the lightweight lock. (Some locks have specific names; others are part of a group of locks each with a similar purpose.) See [Wait Events of Type `LWLock`](#wait-event-lwlock-table). |
| `Timeout` | The server process is waiting for a timeout to expire. `wait_event` will identify the specific wait point; see [Wait Events of Type `Timeout`](#wait-event-timeout-table). |

 The lag times reported in the `pg_stat_replication` view are measurements of the time taken for recent WAL to be written, flushed and replayed and for the sender to know about it. These times represent the commit delay that was (or would have been) introduced by each synchronous commit level, if the remote server was configured as a synchronous standby. For an asynchronous standby, the `replay_lag` column approximates the delay before recent transactions became visible to queries. If the standby server has entirely caught up with the sending server and there is no more WAL activity, the most recently measured lag times will continue to be displayed for a short time and then show NULL.


 Lag times work automatically for physical replication. Logical decoding plugins may optionally emit tracking messages; if they do not, the tracking mechanism will simply display NULL lag.


!!! note

    The reported lag times are not predictions of how long it will take for the standby to catch up with the sending server assuming the current rate of replay. Such a system would show similar times while new WAL is being generated, but would differ when the sender becomes idle. In particular, when the standby has caught up completely, `pg_stat_replication` shows the time taken to write, flush and replay the most recent reported WAL location rather than zero as some users might expect. This is consistent with the goal of measuring synchronous commit and transaction visibility delays for recent write transactions. To reduce confusion for users expecting a different model of lag, the lag columns revert to NULL after a short time on a fully replayed idle system. Monitoring systems should choose whether to represent this as missing data, zero or continue to display the last known value.

 Normally, WAL files are archived in order, oldest to newest, but that is not guaranteed, and does not hold under special circumstances like when promoting a standby or after crash recovery. Therefore it is not safe to assume that all files older than `last_archived_wal` have also been successfully archived.

### `pg_stat_io`


 The `pg_stat_io` view will contain one row for each combination of backend type, target I/O object, and I/O context, showing cluster-wide I/O statistics. Combinations which do not make sense are omitted.


 Currently, I/O on relations (e.g. tables, indexes) is tracked. However, relation I/O which bypasses shared buffers (e.g. when moving a table from one tablespace to another) is currently not tracked.

 Some backend types never perform I/O operations on some I/O objects and/or in some I/O contexts. These rows are omitted from the view. For example, the checkpointer does not checkpoint temporary tables, so there will be no rows for `backend_type` `checkpointer` and `object` `temp relation`.


 In addition, some I/O operations will never be performed either by certain backend types or on certain I/O objects and/or in certain I/O contexts. These cells will be NULL. For example, temporary tables are not `fsync`ed, so `fsyncs` will be NULL for `object` `temp relation`. Also, the background writer does not perform reads, so `reads` will be NULL in rows for `backend_type` `background writer`.


 `pg_stat_io` can be used to inform database tuning. For example:

-  A high `evictions` count can indicate that shared buffers should be increased.
-  Client backends rely on the checkpointer to ensure data is persisted to permanent storage. Large numbers of `fsyncs` by `client backend`s could indicate a misconfiguration of shared buffers or of the checkpointer. More information on configuring the checkpointer can be found in [WAL Configuration](../reliability-and-the-write-ahead-log/wal-configuration.md#wal-configuration).
-  Normally, client backends should be able to rely on auxiliary processes like the checkpointer and the background writer to write out dirty data as much as possible. Large numbers of writes by client backends could indicate a misconfiguration of shared buffers or of the checkpointer. More information on configuring the checkpointer can be found in [WAL Configuration](../reliability-and-the-write-ahead-log/wal-configuration.md#wal-configuration).


!!! note

    Columns tracking I/O time will only be non-zero when [track_io_timing](../server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-track-io-timing) is enabled. The user should be careful when referencing these columns in combination with their corresponding IO operations in case `track_io_timing` was not enabled for the entire time since the last stats reset.

 Indexes can be used by simple index scans, “bitmap” index scans, and the optimizer. In a bitmap scan the output of several indexes can be combined via AND or OR rules, so it is difficult to associate individual heap row fetches with specific indexes when a bitmap scan is used. Therefore, a bitmap scan increments the `pg_stat_all_indexes`.`idx_tup_read` count(s) for the index(es) it uses, and it increments the `pg_stat_all_tables`.`idx_tup_fetch` count for the table, but it does not affect `pg_stat_all_indexes`.`idx_tup_fetch`. The optimizer also accesses indexes to check for supplied constants whose values are outside the recorded range of the optimizer statistics because the optimizer statistics might be stale.


!!! note

    The `idx_tup_read` and `idx_tup_fetch` counts can be different even without any use of bitmap scans, because `idx_tup_read` counts index entries retrieved from the index while `idx_tup_fetch` counts live rows fetched from the table. The latter will be less if any dead or not-yet-committed rows are fetched using the index, or if any heap fetches are avoided by means of an index-only scan.

### Statistics Functions


 Other ways of looking at the statistics can be set up by writing queries that use the same underlying statistics access functions used by the standard views shown above. For details such as the functions' names, consult the definitions of the standard views. (For example, in psql you could issue `\d+ pg_stat_activity`.) The access functions for per-database statistics take a database OID as an argument to identify which database to report on. The per-table and per-index functions take a table or index OID. The functions for per-function statistics take a function OID. Note that only tables, indexes, and functions in the current database can be seen with these functions.


 Additional functions related to the cumulative statistics system are listed in [Additional Statistics Functions](#monitoring-stats-funcs-table).

!!! warning

    Using `pg_stat_reset()` also resets counters that autovacuum uses to determine when to trigger a vacuum or an analyze. Resetting these counters can cause autovacuum to not perform necessary work, which can cause problems such as table bloat or out-dated table statistics. A database-wide `ANALYZE` is recommended after the statistics have been reset.


 `pg_stat_get_activity`, the underlying function of the `pg_stat_activity` view, returns a set of records containing all the available information about each backend process. Sometimes it may be more convenient to obtain just a subset of this information. In such cases, another set of per-backend statistics access functions can be used; these are shown in [Per-Backend Statistics Functions](#monitoring-stats-backend-funcs-table). These access functions use the session's backend ID number, which is a small positive integer that is distinct from the backend ID of any concurrent session, although a session's ID can be recycled as soon as it exits. The backend ID is used, among other things, to identify the session's temporary schema if it has one. The function `pg_stat_get_backend_idset` provides a convenient way to list all the active backends' ID numbers for invoking these functions. For example, to show the PIDs and current queries of all backends:
