## Collation Support


 The collation feature allows specifying the sort order and character classification behavior of data per-column, or even per-operation. This alleviates the restriction that the `LC_COLLATE` and `LC_CTYPE` settings of a database cannot be changed after its creation.
 <a id="collation-concepts"></a>

### Concepts


 Conceptually, every expression of a collatable data type has a collation. (The built-in collatable data types are `text`, `varchar`, and `char`. User-defined base types can also be marked collatable, and of course a *domain* over a collatable data type is collatable.) If the expression is a column reference, the collation of the expression is the defined collation of the column. If the expression is a constant, the collation is the default collation of the data type of the constant. The collation of a more complex expression is derived from the collations of its inputs, as described below.


 The collation of an expression can be the “default” collation, which means the locale settings defined for the database. It is also possible for an expression's collation to be indeterminate. In such cases, ordering operations and other operations that need to know the collation will fail.


 When the database system has to perform an ordering or a character classification, it uses the collation of the input expression. This happens, for example, with `ORDER BY` clauses and function or operator calls such as `<`. The collation to apply for an `ORDER BY` clause is simply the collation of the sort key. The collation to apply for a function or operator call is derived from the arguments, as described below. In addition to comparison operators, collations are taken into account by functions that convert between lower and upper case letters, such as `lower`, `upper`, and `initcap`; by pattern matching operators; and by `to_char` and related functions.


 For a function or operator call, the collation that is derived by examining the argument collations is used at run time for performing the specified operation. If the result of the function or operator call is of a collatable data type, the collation is also used at parse time as the defined collation of the function or operator expression, in case there is a surrounding expression that requires knowledge of its collation.


 The *collation derivation* of an expression can be implicit or explicit. This distinction affects how collations are combined when multiple different collations appear in an expression. An explicit collation derivation occurs when a `COLLATE` clause is used; all other collation derivations are implicit. When multiple collations need to be combined, for example in a function call, the following rules are used:

1.  If any input expression has an explicit collation derivation, then all explicitly derived collations among the input expressions must be the same, otherwise an error is raised. If any explicitly derived collation is present, that is the result of the collation combination.
2.  Otherwise, all input expressions must have the same implicit collation derivation or the default collation. If any non-default collation is present, that is the result of the collation combination. Otherwise, the result is the default collation.
3.  If there are conflicting non-default implicit collations among the input expressions, then the combination is deemed to have indeterminate collation. This is not an error condition unless the particular function being invoked requires knowledge of the collation it should apply. If it does, an error will be raised at run-time.
 For example, consider this table definition:

```sql

CREATE TABLE test1 (
    a text COLLATE "de_DE",
    b text COLLATE "es_ES",
    ...
);
```
 Then in

```sql

SELECT a < 'foo' FROM test1;
```
 the `<` comparison is performed according to `de_DE` rules, because the expression combines an implicitly derived collation with the default collation. But in

```sql

SELECT a < ('foo' COLLATE "fr_FR") FROM test1;
```
 the comparison is performed using `fr_FR` rules, because the explicit collation derivation overrides the implicit one. Furthermore, given

```sql

SELECT a < b FROM test1;
```
 the parser cannot determine which collation to apply, since the `a` and `b` columns have conflicting implicit collations. Since the `<` operator does need to know which collation to use, this will result in an error. The error can be resolved by attaching an explicit collation specifier to either input expression, thus:

```sql

SELECT a < b COLLATE "de_DE" FROM test1;
```
 or equivalently

```sql

SELECT a COLLATE "de_DE" < b FROM test1;
```
 On the other hand, the structurally similar case

```sql

SELECT a || b FROM test1;
```
 does not result in an error, because the `||` operator does not care about collations: its result is the same regardless of the collation.


 The collation assigned to a function or operator's combined input expressions is also considered to apply to the function or operator's result, if the function or operator delivers a result of a collatable data type. So, in

```sql

SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || 'foo';
```
 the ordering will be done according to `de_DE` rules. But this query:

```sql

SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || b;
```
 results in an error, because even though the `||` operator doesn't need to know a collation, the `ORDER BY` clause does. As before, the conflict can be resolved with an explicit collation specifier:

```sql

SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || b COLLATE "fr_FR";
```

### Managing Collations


 A collation is an SQL schema object that maps an SQL name to locales provided by libraries installed in the operating system. A collation definition has a *provider* that specifies which library supplies the locale data. One standard provider name is `libc`, which uses the locales provided by the operating system C library. These are the locales used by most tools provided by the operating system. Another provider is `icu`, which uses the external ICU library. ICU locales can only be used if support for ICU was configured when PostgreSQL was built.


 A collation object provided by `libc` maps to a combination of `LC_COLLATE` and `LC_CTYPE` settings, as accepted by the `setlocale()` system library call. (As the name would suggest, the main purpose of a collation is to set `LC_COLLATE`, which controls the sort order. But it is rarely necessary in practice to have an `LC_CTYPE` setting that is different from `LC_COLLATE`, so it is more convenient to collect these under one concept than to create another infrastructure for setting `LC_CTYPE` per expression.) Also, a `libc` collation is tied to a character set encoding (see [Character Set Support](character-set-support.md#multibyte)). The same collation name may exist for different encodings.


 A collation object provided by `icu` maps to a named collator provided by the ICU library. ICU does not support separate “collate” and “ctype” settings, so they are always the same. Also, ICU collations are independent of the encoding, so there is always only one ICU collation of a given name in a database.
 <a id="collation-managing-standard"></a>

#### Standard Collations


 On all platforms, the collations named `default`, `C`, and `POSIX` are available. Additional collations may be available depending on operating system support. The `default` collation selects the `LC_COLLATE` and `LC_CTYPE` values specified at database creation time. The `C` and `POSIX` collations both specify “traditional C” behavior, in which only the ASCII letters “`A`” through “`Z`” are treated as letters, and sorting is done strictly by character code byte values.


!!! note

    The `C` and `POSIX` locales may behave differently depending on the database encoding.


 Additionally, two SQL standard collation names are available:

`unicode`
:   This collation sorts using the Unicode Collation Algorithm with the Default Unicode Collation Element Table. It is available in all encodings. ICU support is required to use this collation. (This collation has the same behavior as the ICU root locale; see [und-x-icu (for undefined)](#collation-managing-predefined-icu-und-x-icu).)

`ucs_basic`
:   This collation sorts by Unicode code point. It is only available for encoding `UTF8`. (This collation has the same behavior as the libc locale specification `C` in `UTF8` encoding.)

  <a id="collation-managing-predefined"></a>

#### Predefined Collations


 If the operating system provides support for using multiple locales within a single program (`newlocale` and related functions), or if support for ICU is configured, then when a database cluster is initialized, `initdb` populates the system catalog `pg_collation` with collations based on all the locales it finds in the operating system at the time.


 To inspect the currently available locales, use the query `SELECT * FROM pg_collation`, or the command `\dOS+` in psql.
 <a id="collation-managing-predefined-libc"></a>

##### libc Collations


 For example, the operating system might provide a locale named `de_DE.utf8`. `initdb` would then create a collation named `de_DE.utf8` for encoding `UTF8` that has both `LC_COLLATE` and `LC_CTYPE` set to `de_DE.utf8`. It will also create a collation with the `.utf8` tag stripped off the name. So you could also use the collation under the name `de_DE`, which is less cumbersome to write and makes the name less encoding-dependent. Note that, nevertheless, the initial set of collation names is platform-dependent.


 The default set of collations provided by `libc` map directly to the locales installed in the operating system, which can be listed using the command `locale -a`. In case a `libc` collation is needed that has different values for `LC_COLLATE` and `LC_CTYPE`, or if new locales are installed in the operating system after the database system was initialized, then a new collation may be created using the [sql-createcollation](../../reference/sql-commands/create-collation.md#sql-createcollation) command. New operating system locales can also be imported en masse using the [`pg_import_system_collations()`](../../the-sql-language/functions-and-operators/system-administration-functions.md#functions-admin-collation) function.


 Within any particular database, only collations that use that database's encoding are of interest. Other entries in `pg_collation` are ignored. Thus, a stripped collation name such as `de_DE` can be considered unique within a given database even though it would not be unique globally. Use of the stripped collation names is recommended, since it will make one fewer thing you need to change if you decide to change to another database encoding. Note however that the `default`, `C`, and `POSIX` collations can be used regardless of the database encoding.


 PostgreSQL considers distinct collation objects to be incompatible even when they have identical properties. Thus for example,

```sql

SELECT a COLLATE "C" < b COLLATE "POSIX" FROM test1;
```
 will draw an error even though the `C` and `POSIX` collations have identical behaviors. Mixing stripped and non-stripped collation names is therefore not recommended.
  <a id="collation-managing-predefined-icu"></a>

##### ICU Collations


 With ICU, it is not sensible to enumerate all possible locale names. ICU uses a particular naming system for locales, but there are many more ways to name a locale than there are actually distinct locales. `initdb` uses the ICU APIs to extract a set of distinct locales to populate the initial set of collations. Collations provided by ICU are created in the SQL environment with names in BCP 47 language tag format, with a “private use” extension `-x-icu` appended, to distinguish them from libc locales.


 Here are some example collations that might be created:

<a id="collation-managing-predefined-icu-de-x-icu"></a>

`de-x-icu`
:   German collation, default variant
<a id="collation-managing-predefined-icu-de-at-x-icu"></a>

`de-AT-x-icu`
:   German collation for Austria, default variant


     (There are also, say, `de-DE-x-icu` or `de-CH-x-icu`, but as of this writing, they are equivalent to `de-x-icu`.)
<a id="collation-managing-predefined-icu-und-x-icu"></a>

`und-x-icu` (for “undefined”)
:   ICU “root” collation. Use this to get a reasonable language-agnostic sort order.


 Some (less frequently used) encodings are not supported by ICU. When the database encoding is one of these, ICU collation entries in `pg_collation` are ignored. Attempting to use one will draw an error along the lines of “collation "de-x-icu" for encoding "WIN874" does not exist”.
   <a id="collation-create"></a>

#### Creating New Collation Objects


 If the standard and predefined collations are not sufficient, users can create their own collation objects using the SQL command [sql-createcollation](../../reference/sql-commands/create-collation.md#sql-createcollation).


 The standard and predefined collations are in the schema `pg_catalog`, like all predefined objects. User-defined collations should be created in user schemas. This also ensures that they are saved by `pg_dump`.
 <a id="collation-managing-create-libc"></a>

##### libc Collations


 New libc collations can be created like this:

```sql

CREATE COLLATION german (provider = libc, locale = 'de_DE');
```
 The exact values that are acceptable for the `locale` clause in this command depend on the operating system. On Unix-like systems, the command `locale -a` will show a list.


 Since the predefined libc collations already include all collations defined in the operating system when the database instance is initialized, it is not often necessary to manually create new ones. Reasons might be if a different naming system is desired (in which case see also [Copying Collations](#collation-copy)) or if the operating system has been upgraded to provide new locale definitions (in which case see also [`pg_import_system_collations()`](../../the-sql-language/functions-and-operators/system-administration-functions.md#functions-admin-collation)).
  <a id="collation-managing-create-icu"></a>

##### ICU Collations


 ICU collations can be created like:

```sql

CREATE COLLATION german (provider = icu, locale = 'de-DE');
```
 ICU locales are specified as a BCP 47 [Language Tag](locale-support.md#icu-language-tag), but can also accept most libc-style locale names. If possible, libc-style locale names are transformed into language tags.


 New ICU collations can customize collation behavior extensively by including collation attributes in the language tag. See [ICU Custom Collations](#icu-custom-collations) for details and examples.
  <a id="collation-copy"></a>

##### Copying Collations


 The command [sql-createcollation](../../reference/sql-commands/create-collation.md#sql-createcollation) can also be used to create a new collation from an existing collation, which can be useful to be able to use operating-system-independent collation names in applications, create compatibility names, or use an ICU-provided collation under a more readable name. For example:

```sql

CREATE COLLATION german FROM "de_DE";
CREATE COLLATION french FROM "fr-x-icu";
```

   <a id="collation-nondeterministic"></a>

#### Nondeterministic Collations


 A collation is either *deterministic* or *nondeterministic*. A deterministic collation uses deterministic comparisons, which means that it considers strings to be equal only if they consist of the same byte sequence. Nondeterministic comparison may determine strings to be equal even if they consist of different bytes. Typical situations include case-insensitive comparison, accent-insensitive comparison, as well as comparison of strings in different Unicode normal forms. It is up to the collation provider to actually implement such insensitive comparisons; the deterministic flag only determines whether ties are to be broken using bytewise comparison. See also [Unicode Technical Standard 10](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10) for more information on the terminology.


 To create a nondeterministic collation, specify the property `deterministic = false` to `CREATE COLLATION`, for example:

```sql

CREATE COLLATION ndcoll (provider = icu, locale = 'und', deterministic = false);
```
 This example would use the standard Unicode collation in a nondeterministic way. In particular, this would allow strings in different normal forms to be compared correctly. More interesting examples make use of the ICU customization facilities explained above. For example:

```sql

CREATE COLLATION case_insensitive (provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-ks-level2', deterministic = false);
CREATE COLLATION ignore_accents (provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-ks-level1-kc-true', deterministic = false);
```


 All standard and predefined collations are deterministic, all user-defined collations are deterministic by default. While nondeterministic collations give a more “correct” behavior, especially when considering the full power of Unicode and its many special cases, they also have some drawbacks. Foremost, their use leads to a performance penalty. Note, in particular, that B-tree cannot use deduplication with indexes that use a nondeterministic collation. Also, certain operations are not possible with nondeterministic collations, such as pattern matching operations. Therefore, they should be used only in cases where they are specifically wanted.


!!! tip

    To deal with text in different Unicode normalization forms, it is also an option to use the functions/expressions `normalize` and `is normalized` to preprocess or check the strings, instead of using nondeterministic collations. There are different trade-offs for each approach.
   <a id="icu-custom-collations"></a>

### ICU Custom Collations


 ICU allows extensive control over collation behavior by defining new collations with collation settings as a part of the language tag. These settings can modify the collation order to suit a variety of needs. For instance:

```

-- ignore differences in accents and case
CREATE COLLATION ignore_accent_case (provider = icu, deterministic = false, locale = 'und-u-ks-level1');
SELECT 'Å' = 'A' COLLATE ignore_accent_case; -- true
SELECT 'z' = 'Z' COLLATE ignore_accent_case; -- true

-- upper case letters sort before lower case.
CREATE COLLATION upper_first (provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-kf-upper');
SELECT 'B' < 'b' COLLATE upper_first; -- true

-- treat digits numerically and ignore punctuation
CREATE COLLATION num_ignore_punct (provider = icu, deterministic = false, locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-kn');
SELECT 'id-45' < 'id-123' COLLATE num_ignore_punct; -- true
SELECT 'w;x*y-z' = 'wxyz' COLLATE num_ignore_punct; -- true
```
 Many of the available options are described in [Collation Settings for an ICU Locale](#icu-collation-settings), or see [External References for ICU](#icu-external-references) for more details.
 <a id="icu-collation-comparison-levels"></a>

#### ICU Comparison Levels


 Comparison of two strings (collation) in ICU is determined by a multi-level process, where textual features are grouped into "levels". Treatment of each level is controlled by the [collation settings](#icu-collation-settings-table). Higher levels correspond to finer textual features.


 [ICU Collation Levels](#icu-collation-levels) shows which textual feature differences are considered significant when determining equality at the given level. The Unicode character `U+2063` is an invisible separator, and as seen in the table, is ignored for at all levels of comparison less than `identic`.
 <a id="icu-collation-levels"></a>

**Table: ICU Collation Levels**

| Level | Description | `'f' = 'f'` | `'ab' = U&'a\2063b'` | `'x-y' = 'x_y'` | `'g' = 'G'` | `'n' = 'ñ'` | `'y' = 'z'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| level1 | Base Character | `true` | `true` | `true` | `true` | `true` | `false` |
| level2 | Accents | `true` | `true` | `true` | `true` | `false` | `false` |
| level3 | Case/Variants | `true` | `true` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| level4 | Punctuation | `true` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| identic | All | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` | `false` | `false` |


 At every level, even with full normalization off, basic normalization is performed. For example, `'á'` may be composed of the code points `U&'\0061\0301'` or the single code point `U&'\00E1'`, and those sequences will be considered equal even at the `identic` level. To treat any difference in code point representation as distinct, use a collation created with `deterministic` set to `true`.
 <a id="icu-collation-level-examples"></a>

##### Collation Level Examples


```sql

CREATE COLLATION level3 (provider = icu, deterministic = false, locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-ks-level3');
CREATE COLLATION level4 (provider = icu, deterministic = false, locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-ks-level4');
CREATE COLLATION identic (provider = icu, deterministic = false, locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-ks-identic');

-- invisible separator ignored at all levels except identic
SELECT 'ab' = U&'a\2063b' COLLATE level4; -- true
SELECT 'ab' = U&'a\2063b' COLLATE identic; -- false

-- punctuation ignored at level3 but not at level 4
SELECT 'x-y' = 'x_y' COLLATE level3; -- true
SELECT 'x-y' = 'x_y' COLLATE level4; -- false
```

 [ICU Collation Settings](#icu-collation-settings-table) shows the available collation settings, which can be used as part of a language tag to customize a collation.

!!! note

    For many collation settings, you must create the collation with `deterministic` set to `false` for the setting to have the desired effect (see [Nondeterministic Collations](#collation-nondeterministic)). Additionally, some settings only take effect when the key `ka` is set to `shifted` (see [ICU Collation Settings](#icu-collation-settings-table)).

`CREATE COLLATION "de-u-co-phonebk-x-icu" (provider = icu, locale = 'de-u-co-phonebk');`
:   German collation with phone book collation type
<a id="collation-managing-create-icu-und-u-co-emoji-x-icu"></a>

`CREATE COLLATION "und-u-co-emoji-x-icu" (provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-co-emoji');`
:   Root collation with Emoji collation type, per Unicode Technical Standard #51
<a id="collation-managing-create-icu-en-u-kr-grek-latn"></a>

`CREATE COLLATION latinlast (provider = icu, locale = 'en-u-kr-grek-latn');`

`CREATE COLLATION upperfirst (provider = icu, locale = 'en-u-kf-upper');`
:   Sort upper-case letters before lower-case letters. (The default is lower-case letters first.)

`CREATE COLLATION special (provider = icu, locale = 'en-u-kf-upper-kr-grek-latn');`
:   Combines both of the above options.
  <a id="icu-tailoring-rules"></a>

#### ICU Tailoring Rules


 If the options provided by the collation settings shown above are not sufficient, the order of collation elements can be changed with tailoring rules, whose syntax is detailed at [https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation/customization/](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation/customization/).


 This small example creates a collation based on the root locale with a tailoring rule:

```sql

CREATE COLLATION custom (provider = icu, locale = 'und', rules = '&V << w <<< W');
```
 With this rule, the letter “W” is sorted after “V”, but is treated as a secondary difference similar to an accent. Rules like this are contained in the locale definitions of some languages. (Of course, if a locale definition already contains the desired rules, then they don't need to be specified again explicitly.)


 Here is a more complex example. The following statement sets up a collation named `ebcdic` with rules to sort US-ASCII characters in the order of the EBCDIC encoding.

```sql

CREATE COLLATION ebcdic (provider = icu, locale = 'und',
rules = $$
& ' ' < '.' < '<' < '(' < '+' < \|
< '&' < '!' < '$' < '*' < ')' < ';'
< '-' < '/' < ',' < '%' < '_' < '>' < '?'
< '`' < ':' < '#' < '@' < \' < '=' < '"'
<*a-r < '~' <*s-z < '^' < '[' < ']'
< '{' <*A-I < '}' <*J-R < '\' <*S-Z <*0-9
$$);

SELECT c
FROM (VALUES ('a'), ('b'), ('A'), ('B'), ('1'), ('2'), ('!'), ('^')) AS x(c)
ORDER BY c COLLATE ebcdic;
