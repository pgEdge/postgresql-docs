### Server Signaling Functions


 The functions shown in [Server Signaling Functions](#functions-admin-signal-table) send control signals to other server processes. Use of these functions is restricted to superusers by default but access may be granted to others using `GRANT`, with noted exceptions.


 Each of these functions returns `true` if the signal was successfully sent and `false` if sending the signal failed.

<td>If <code>timeout</code> is not specified or zero, this function returns <code>true</code> whether the process actually terminates or not, indicating only that the sending of the signal was successful. If the <code>timeout</code> is specified (in milliseconds) and greater than zero, the function waits until the process is actually terminated or until the given time has passed. If the process is terminated, the function returns <code>true</code>. On timeout, a warning is emitted and <code>false</code> is returned.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


 `pg_cancel_backend` and `pg_terminate_backend` send signals (`SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` respectively) to backend processes identified by process ID. The process ID of an active backend can be found from the `pid` column of the `pg_stat_activity` view, or by listing the `postgres` processes on the server (using ps on Unix or the Task Manager on Windows). The role of an active backend can be found from the `usename` column of the `pg_stat_activity` view.


 `pg_log_backend_memory_contexts` can be used to log the memory contexts of a backend process. For example:

```

postgres=# SELECT pg_log_backend_memory_contexts(pg_backend_pid());
 pg_log_backend_memory_contexts
--------------------------------
 t
(1 row)
```
 One message for each memory context will be logged. For example:

```

LOG:  logging memory contexts of PID 10377
STATEMENT:  SELECT pg_log_backend_memory_contexts(pg_backend_pid());
LOG:  level: 1; TopMemoryContext: 80800 total in 6 blocks; 14432 free (5 chunks); 66368 used
LOG:  level: 2; pgstat TabStatusArray lookup hash table: 8192 total in 1 blocks; 1408 free (0 chunks); 6784 used
LOG:  level: 2; TopTransactionContext: 8192 total in 1 blocks; 7720 free (1 chunks); 472 used

LOG:  Grand total: 1651920 bytes in 201 blocks; 622360 free (88 chunks); 1029560 used
```
 If there are more than 100 child contexts under the same parent, the first 100 child contexts are logged, along with a summary of the remaining contexts. Note that frequent calls to this function could incur significant overhead, because it may generate a large number of log messages.

### Backup Control Functions


 The functions shown in [Backup Control Functions](#functions-admin-backup-table) assist in making on-line backups. These functions cannot be executed during recovery (except `pg_backup_start`, `pg_backup_stop`, and `pg_wal_lsn_diff`).


 For details about proper usage of these functions, see [Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)](../../server-administration/backup-and-restore/continuous-archiving-and-point-in-time-recovery-pitr.md#continuous-archiving).

(Typically this would be the name under which the backup dump file will be stored.) If the optional second parameter is given as <code>true</code>, it specifies executing <code>pg_backup_start</code> as quickly as possible. This forces a fast checkpoint which will cause a spike in I/O operations, slowing any concurrently executing queries.</td>

<tr>
<td><code>pg_backup_stop</code> ( [<code>wait_for_archive</code> <code>boolean</code> ] ) <code>record</code> ( <code>lsn</code> <code>pg_lsn</code>, <code>labelfile</code> <code>text</code>, <code>spcmapfile</code> <code>text</code> )</td>
<td>Finishes performing an on-line backup. The desired contents of the backup label file and the tablespace map file are returned as part of the result of the function and must be written to files in the backup area. These files must not be written to the live data directory (doing so will cause PostgreSQL to fail to restart in the event of a crash).</td>
<td>There is an optional parameter of type <code>boolean</code>. If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed, without waiting for WAL to be archived. This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving. Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless. By default or when this parameter is true, <code>pg_backup_stop</code> will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is enabled. (On a standby, this means that it will wait only when <code>archive_mode</code> = <code>always</code>. If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run <code>pg_switch_wal</code> on the primary in order to trigger an immediate segment switch.)<br>When executed on a primary, this function also creates a backup history file in the write-ahead log archive area. The history file includes the label given to <code>pg_backup_start</code>, the starting and ending write-ahead log locations for the backup, and the starting and ending times of the backup. After recording the ending location, the current write-ahead log insertion point is automatically advanced to the next write-ahead log file, so that the ending write-ahead log file can be archived immediately to complete the backup.<br>The result of the function is a single record. The <code>lsn</code> column holds the backup's ending write-ahead log location (which again can be ignored). The second column returns the contents of the backup label file, and the third column returns the contents of the tablespace map file. These must be stored as part of the backup and are required as part of the restore process.<br>This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pg_switch_wal</code> () <code>pg_lsn</code></td>
<td>Forces the server to switch to a new write-ahead log file, which allows the current file to be archived (assuming you are using continuous archiving).

If there has been no write-ahead log activity since the last write-ahead log switch, <code>pg_switch_wal</code> does nothing and returns the start location of the write-ahead log file currently in use.</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


 `pg_current_wal_lsn` displays the current write-ahead log write location in the same format used by the above functions. Similarly, `pg_current_wal_insert_lsn` displays the current write-ahead log insertion location and `pg_current_wal_flush_lsn` displays the current write-ahead log flush location. The insertion location is the “logical” end of the write-ahead log at any instant, while the write location is the end of what has actually been written out from the server's internal buffers, and the flush location is the last location known to be written to durable storage. The write location is the end of what can be examined from outside the server, and is usually what you want if you are interested in archiving partially-complete write-ahead log files. The insertion and flush locations are made available primarily for server debugging purposes. These are all read-only operations and do not require superuser permissions.


 You can use `pg_walfile_name_offset` to extract the corresponding write-ahead log file name and byte offset from a `pg_lsn` value. For example:

```

postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_walfile_name_offset((pg_backup_stop()).lsn);
        file_name         | file_offset
--------------------------+-------------
 00000001000000000000000D |     4039624
(1 row)
```
 Similarly, `pg_walfile_name` extracts just the write-ahead log file name.


 `pg_split_walfile_name` is useful to compute a LSN from a file offset and WAL file name, for example:

```

postgres=# \set file_name '000000010000000100C000AB'
postgres=# \set offset 256
postgres=# SELECT '0/0'::pg_lsn + pd.segment_number * ps.setting::int + :offset AS lsn
  FROM pg_split_walfile_name(:'file_name') pd,
       pg_show_all_settings() ps
  WHERE ps.name = 'wal_segment_size';
      lsn
---------------
 C001/AB000100
(1 row)
```

### Recovery Control Functions


 The functions shown in [Recovery Information Functions](#functions-recovery-info-table) provide information about the current status of a standby server. These functions may be executed both during recovery and in normal running.

<td>Returns the time stamp of the last transaction replayed during recovery. This is the time at which the commit or abort WAL record for that transaction was generated on the primary. If no transactions have been replayed during recovery, the function returns <code>NULL</code>. Otherwise, if recovery is still in progress this will increase monotonically. If recovery has completed then this will remain static at the time of the last transaction applied during recovery. When the server has been started normally without recovery, the function returns <code>NULL</code>.</td>

If <code>wait</code> is set to <code>false</code>, the function returns <code>true</code> immediately after sending a <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal to the postmaster to trigger promotion.</td>
<td>This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pg_wal_replay_pause</code> () <code>void</code></td>
<td>Request to pause recovery. A request doesn't mean that recovery stops right away. If you want a guarantee that recovery is actually paused, you need to check for the recovery pause state returned by <code>pg_get_wal_replay_pause_state()</code>. Note that <code>pg_is_wal_replay_paused()</code> returns whether a request is made. While recovery is paused, no further database changes are applied. If hot standby is active, all new queries will see the same consistent snapshot of the database, and no further query conflicts will be generated until recovery is resumed.</td>
<td>This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pg_wal_replay_resume</code> () <code>void</code></td>
<td>Restarts recovery if it was paused.</td>
<td>This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


 `pg_wal_replay_pause` and `pg_wal_replay_resume` cannot be executed while a promotion is ongoing. If a promotion is triggered while recovery is paused, the paused state ends and promotion continues.


 If streaming replication is disabled, the paused state may continue indefinitely without a problem. If streaming replication is in progress then WAL records will continue to be received, which will eventually fill available disk space, depending upon the duration of the pause, the rate of WAL generation and available disk space.

### Snapshot Synchronization Functions


 PostgreSQL allows database sessions to synchronize their snapshots. A *snapshot* determines which data is visible to the transaction that is using the snapshot. Synchronized snapshots are necessary when two or more sessions need to see identical content in the database. If two sessions just start their transactions independently, there is always a possibility that some third transaction commits between the executions of the two `START TRANSACTION` commands, so that one session sees the effects of that transaction and the other does not.


 To solve this problem, PostgreSQL allows a transaction to *export* the snapshot it is using. As long as the exporting transaction remains open, other transactions can *import* its snapshot, and thereby be guaranteed that they see exactly the same view of the database that the first transaction sees. But note that any database changes made by any one of these transactions remain invisible to the other transactions, as is usual for changes made by uncommitted transactions. So the transactions are synchronized with respect to pre-existing data, but act normally for changes they make themselves.


 Snapshots are exported with the `pg_export_snapshot` function, shown in [Snapshot Synchronization Functions](#functions-snapshot-synchronization-table), and imported with the [sql-set-transaction](../../reference/sql-commands/set-transaction.md#sql-set-transaction) command.

This string must be passed (outside the database) to clients that want to import the snapshot. The snapshot is available for import only until the end of the transaction that exported it.</td>
<td>A transaction can export more than one snapshot, if needed. Note that doing so is only useful in <code>READ COMMITTED</code> transactions, since in <code>REPEATABLE READ</code> and higher isolation levels, transactions use the same snapshot throughout their lifetime. Once a transaction has exported any snapshots, it cannot be prepared with <a href="../../reference/sql-commands/prepare-transaction.md#sql-prepare-transaction">sql-prepare-transaction</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pg_log_standby_snapshot</code> () <code>pg_lsn</code></td>

### Replication Management Functions


 The functions shown in [Replication Management Functions](#functions-replication-table) are for controlling and interacting with replication features. See [Streaming Replication](../../server-administration/high-availability-load-balancing-and-replication/log-shipping-standby-servers.md#streaming-replication), [Replication Slots](../../server-administration/high-availability-load-balancing-and-replication/log-shipping-standby-servers.md#streaming-replication-slots), and [Replication Progress Tracking](../../server-programming/replication-progress-tracking.md#replication-origins) for information about the underlying features. Use of functions for replication origin is only allowed to the superuser by default, but may be allowed to other users by using the `GRANT` command. Use of functions for replication slots is restricted to superusers and users having `REPLICATION` privilege.


 Many of these functions have equivalent commands in the replication protocol; see [Streaming Replication Protocol](../../internals/frontend-backend-protocol/streaming-replication-protocol.md#protocol-replication).


 The functions described in [Backup Control Functions](#functions-admin-backup), [Recovery Control Functions](#functions-recovery-control), and [Snapshot Synchronization Functions](#functions-snapshot-synchronization) are also relevant for replication.

### Database Object Management Functions


 The functions shown in [Database Object Size Functions](#functions-admin-dbsize) calculate the disk space usage of database objects, or assist in presentation or understanding of usage results. `bigint` results are measured in bytes. If an OID that does not represent an existing object is passed to one of these functions, `NULL` is returned.

 The functions above that operate on tables or indexes accept a `regclass` argument, which is simply the OID of the table or index in the `pg_class` system catalog. You do not have to look up the OID by hand, however, since the `regclass` data type's input converter will do the work for you. See [Object Identifier Types](../data-types/object-identifier-types.md#datatype-oid) for details.

### Index Maintenance Functions


 [Index Maintenance Functions](#functions-admin-index-table) shows the functions available for index maintenance tasks. (Note that these maintenance tasks are normally done automatically by autovacuum; use of these functions is only required in special cases.) These functions cannot be executed during recovery. Use of these functions is restricted to superusers and the owner of the given index.

### Generic File Access Functions


 The functions shown in [Generic File Access Functions](#functions-admin-genfile-table) provide native access to files on the machine hosting the server. Only files within the database cluster directory and the `log_directory` can be accessed, unless the user is a superuser or is granted the role `pg_read_server_files`. Use a relative path for files in the cluster directory, and a path matching the `log_directory` configuration setting for log files.


 Note that granting users the EXECUTE privilege on `pg_read_file()`, or related functions, allows them the ability to read any file on the server that the database server process can read; these functions bypass all in-database privilege checks. This means that, for example, a user with such access is able to read the contents of the `pg_authid` table where authentication information is stored, as well as read any table data in the database. Therefore, granting access to these functions should be carefully considered.


 When granting privilege on these functions, note that the table entries showing optional parameters are mostly implemented as several physical functions with different parameter lists. Privilege must be granted separately on each such function, if it is to be used. psql's `\df` command can be useful to check what the actual function signatures are.


 Some of these functions take an optional `missing_ok` parameter, which specifies the behavior when the file or directory does not exist. If `true`, the function returns `NULL` or an empty result set, as appropriate. If `false`, an error is raised. (Failure conditions other than “file not found” are reported as errors in any case.) The default is `false`.

### Advisory Lock Functions


 The functions shown in [Advisory Lock Functions](#functions-advisory-locks-table) manage advisory locks. For details about proper use of these functions, see [Advisory Locks](../concurrency-control/explicit-locking.md#advisory-locks).


 All these functions are intended to be used to lock application-defined resources, which can be identified either by a single 64-bit key value or two 32-bit key values (note that these two key spaces do not overlap). If another session already holds a conflicting lock on the same resource identifier, the functions will either wait until the resource becomes available, or return a `false` result, as appropriate for the function. Locks can be either shared or exclusive: a shared lock does not conflict with other shared locks on the same resource, only with exclusive locks. Locks can be taken at session level (so that they are held until released or the session ends) or at transaction level (so that they are held until the current transaction ends; there is no provision for manual release). Multiple session-level lock requests stack, so that if the same resource identifier is locked three times there must then be three unlock requests to release the resource in advance of session end.
