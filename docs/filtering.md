# Filtering

There are a few ways to index nearest neighbor queries with a `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category_id = 123 ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

A good place to start is creating an index on the filter column. This can provide fast, exact nearest neighbor search in many cases. Postgres has a number of [index types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html) for this: B-tree (default), hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, and BRIN.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items (category_id);
```

For multiple columns, consider a [multicolumn index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-multicolumn.html).

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items (location_id, category_id);
```

Exact indexes work well for conditions that match a low percentage of rows. Otherwise, [approximate indexes](performance.md#indexing) can work better.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

With approximate indexes, filtering is applied *after* the index is scanned. If a condition matches 10% of rows, with HNSW and the default `hnsw.ef_search` of 40, only 4 rows will match on average. For more rows, increase `hnsw.ef_search`.

```sql
SET hnsw.ef_search = 200;
```

Starting with 0.8.0, you can enable [iterative index scans](iterative-index-scans.md), which will automatically scan more of the index when needed.

```sql
SET hnsw.iterative_scan = strict_order;
```

If filtering by only a few distinct values, consider [partial indexing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html).

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WHERE (category_id = 123);
```

If filtering by many different values, consider [partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html).

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (embedding vector(3), category_id int) PARTITION BY LIST(category_id);
```
