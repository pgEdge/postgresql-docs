# Upgrading

[Install](installation.md) the latest version (use the same method as the original installation). Then in each database you want to upgrade, run:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION vector UPDATE;
```

You can check the version in the current database with:

```sql
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
```
