# System Views

 In addition to the system catalogs, PostgreSQL provides a number of built-in views. Some system views provide convenient access to some commonly used queries on the system catalogs. Other views provide access to internal server state.

 The information schema ([The Information Schema](../../client-interfaces/the-information-schema/index.md#information-schema)) provides an alternative set of views which overlap the functionality of the system views. Since the information schema is SQL-standard whereas the views described here are PostgreSQL-specific, it's usually better to use the information schema if it provides all the information you need.

 [System Views](overview.md#view-table) lists the system views described here. More detailed documentation of each view follows below. There are some additional views that provide access to accumulated statistics; they are described in [Collected Statistics Views](../../server-administration/monitoring-database-activity/the-cumulative-statistics-system.md#monitoring-stats-views-table).
