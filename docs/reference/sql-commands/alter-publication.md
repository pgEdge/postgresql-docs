where PUBLICATION_OBJECT is one of:

    TABLE TABLE_AND_COLUMNS [, ... ]
    TABLES IN SCHEMA { SCHEMA_NAME | CURRENT_SCHEMA } [, ... ]

and PUBLICATION_DROP_OBJECT is one of:

    TABLE [ ONLY ] TABLE_NAME [ * ] [, ... ]
    TABLES IN SCHEMA { SCHEMA_NAME | CURRENT_SCHEMA } [, ... ]

## Description


 The command `ALTER PUBLICATION` can change the attributes of a publication.


 The first three variants change which tables/schemas are part of the publication. The `SET` clause will replace the list of tables/schemas in the publication with the specified list; the existing tables/schemas that were present in the publication will be removed. The `ADD` and `DROP` clauses will add and remove one or more tables/schemas from the publication. Note that adding tables/schemas to a publication that is already subscribed to will require an `ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION` action on the subscribing side in order to become effective. Note also that `DROP TABLES IN SCHEMA` will not drop any schema tables that were specified using [`FOR TABLE`](create-publication.md#sql-createpublication-for-table)/ `ADD TABLE`.


 The fourth variant of this command listed in the synopsis can change all of the publication properties specified in [sql-createpublication](create-publication.md#sql-createpublication). Properties not mentioned in the command retain their previous settings.


 The remaining variants change the owner and the name of the publication.


 You must own the publication to use `ALTER PUBLICATION`. Adding a table to a publication additionally requires owning that table. The `ADD TABLES IN SCHEMA` and `SET TABLES IN SCHEMA` to a publication requires the invoking user to be a superuser. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the database. Also, the new owner of a [`FOR ALL TABLES`](create-publication.md#sql-createpublication-for-all-tables) or [`FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA`](create-publication.md#sql-createpublication-for-tables-in-schema) publication must be a superuser. However, a superuser can change the ownership of a publication regardless of these restrictions.


 Adding/Setting any schema when the publication also publishes a table with a column list, and vice versa is not supported.


## Parameters


*name*
:   The name of an existing publication whose definition is to be altered.

*table_name*
:   Name of an existing table. If `ONLY` is specified before the table name, only that table is affected. If `ONLY` is not specified, the table and all its descendant tables (if any) are affected. Optionally, `*` can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included.


     Optionally, a column list can be specified. See [sql-createpublication](create-publication.md#sql-createpublication) for details. Note that a subscription having several publications in which the same table has been published with different column lists is not supported. See [Warning: Combining Column Lists from Multiple Publications](../../server-administration/logical-replication/column-lists.md#logical-replication-col-list-combining) for details of potential problems when altering column lists.


     If the optional `WHERE` clause is specified, rows for which the *expression* evaluates to false or null will not be published. Note that parentheses are required around the expression. The *expression* is evaluated with the role used for the replication connection.

*schema_name*
:   Name of an existing schema.

<code>SET ( </code><em>publication_parameter</em><code> [= </code><em>value</em><code>] [, ... ] )</code>
:   This clause alters publication parameters originally set by [sql-createpublication](create-publication.md#sql-createpublication). See there for more information.

*new_owner*
:   The user name of the new owner of the publication.

*new_name*
:   The new name for the publication.


## Examples


 Change the publication to publish only deletes and updates:

```sql

ALTER PUBLICATION noinsert SET (publish = 'update, delete');
```


 Add some tables to the publication:

```sql

ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication ADD TABLE users (user_id, firstname), departments;
```


 Change the set of columns published for a table:

```sql

ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication SET TABLE users (user_id, firstname, lastname), TABLE departments;
```


 Add schemas `marketing` and `sales` to the publication `sales_publication`:

```sql

ALTER PUBLICATION sales_publication ADD TABLES IN SCHEMA marketing, sales;
```


 Add tables `users`, `departments` and schema `production` to the publication `production_publication`:

```sql

ALTER PUBLICATION production_publication ADD TABLE users, departments, TABLES IN SCHEMA production;
```


## Compatibility


 `ALTER PUBLICATION` is a PostgreSQL extension.
