# ALTER POLICY

change the definition of a row-level security policy

## Synopsis


```

ALTER POLICY NAME ON TABLE_NAME RENAME TO NEW_NAME

ALTER POLICY NAME ON TABLE_NAME
    [ TO { ROLE_NAME | PUBLIC | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, ...] ]
    [ USING ( USING_EXPRESSION ) ]
    [ WITH CHECK ( CHECK_EXPRESSION ) ]
```


## Description


 `ALTER POLICY` changes the definition of an existing row-level security policy. Note that `ALTER POLICY` only allows the set of roles to which the policy applies and the `USING` and `WITH CHECK` expressions to be modified. To change other properties of a policy, such as the command to which it applies or whether it is permissive or restrictive, the policy must be dropped and recreated.


 To use `ALTER POLICY`, you must own the table that the policy applies to.


 In the second form of `ALTER POLICY`, the role list, *using_expression*, and *check_expression* are replaced independently if specified. When one of those clauses is omitted, the corresponding part of the policy is unchanged.


## Parameters


*name*
:   The name of an existing policy to alter.

*table_name*
:   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table that the policy is on.

*new_name*
:   The new name for the policy.

*role_name*
:   The role(s) to which the policy applies. Multiple roles can be specified at one time. To apply the policy to all roles, use `PUBLIC`.

*using_expression*
:   The `USING` expression for the policy. See [sql-createpolicy](create-policy.md#sql-createpolicy) for details.

*check_expression*
:   The `WITH CHECK` expression for the policy. See [sql-createpolicy](create-policy.md#sql-createpolicy) for details.


## Compatibility


 `ALTER POLICY` is a PostgreSQL extension.
