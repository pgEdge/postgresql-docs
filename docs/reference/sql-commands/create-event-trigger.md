# CREATE EVENT TRIGGER

define a new event trigger

## Synopsis


```

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER NAME
    ON EVENT
    [ WHEN FILTER_VARIABLE IN (FILTER_VALUE [, ... ]) [ AND ... ] ]
    EXECUTE { FUNCTION | PROCEDURE } FUNCTION_NAME()
```


## Description


 `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER` creates a new event trigger. Whenever the designated event occurs and the `WHEN` condition associated with the trigger, if any, is satisfied, the trigger function will be executed. For a general introduction to event triggers, see [Event Triggers](../../server-programming/event-triggers/index.md#event-triggers). The user who creates an event trigger becomes its owner.


## Parameters


*name*
:   The name to give the new trigger. This name must be unique within the database.

*event*
:   The name of the event that triggers a call to the given function. See [Overview of Event Trigger Behavior](../../server-programming/event-triggers/overview-of-event-trigger-behavior.md#event-trigger-definition) for more information on event names.

*filter_variable*
:   The name of a variable used to filter events. This makes it possible to restrict the firing of the trigger to a subset of the cases in which it is supported. Currently the only supported *filter_variable* is `TAG`.

*filter_value*
:   A list of values for the associated *filter_variable* for which the trigger should fire. For `TAG`, this means a list of command tags (e.g., `'DROP FUNCTION'`).

*function_name*
:   A user-supplied function that is declared as taking no argument and returning type `event_trigger`.


     In the syntax of `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER`, the keywords `FUNCTION` and `PROCEDURE` are equivalent, but the referenced function must in any case be a function, not a procedure. The use of the keyword `PROCEDURE` here is historical and deprecated.

## Notes


 Only superusers can create event triggers.


 Event triggers are disabled in single-user mode (see [app-postgres](../postgresql-server-applications/postgres.md#app-postgres)). If an erroneous event trigger disables the database so much that you can't even drop the trigger, restart in single-user mode and you'll be able to do that.

## Examples


 Forbid the execution of any [DDL](../../the-sql-language/data-definition/index.md#ddl) command:

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION abort_any_command()
  RETURNS event_trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
  AS $$
BEGIN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'command % is disabled', tg_tag;
END;
$$;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER abort_ddl ON ddl_command_start
   EXECUTE FUNCTION abort_any_command();
```
