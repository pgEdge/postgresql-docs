## Description


 pg_dumpall is a utility for writing out (“dumping”) all PostgreSQL databases of a cluster into an SQL script file or an archive. The output contains SQL commands that can be used as input to [app-psql](psql.md#app-psql) to restore the databases. It does this by calling [app-pgdump](pg_dump.md#app-pgdump) for each database in the cluster. pg_dumpall also dumps global objects that are common to all databases, namely database roles, tablespaces, and privilege grants for configuration parameters. (pg_dump does not save these objects.)


 Since pg_dumpall reads tables from all databases you will most likely have to connect as a database superuser in order to produce a complete dump. Also you will need superuser privileges to execute the saved script in order to be allowed to add roles and create databases.


 Plain text SQL scripts will be written to the standard output. Use the `-f`/`--file` option or shell operators to redirect it into a file.


 Archives in other formats will be placed in a directory named using the `-f`/`--file`, which is required in this case.


 pg_dumpall needs to connect several times to the PostgreSQL server (once per database). If you use password authentication it will ask for a password each time. It is convenient to have a `~/.pgpass` file in such cases. See [The Password File](../../client-interfaces/libpq-c-library/the-password-file.md#libpq-pgpass) for more information.


!!! warning

    Restoring a dump causes the destination to execute arbitrary code of the source superusers' choice. Partial dumps and partial restores do not limit that. If the source superusers are not trusted, the dumped SQL statements must be inspected before restoring. Note that the client running the dump and restore need not trust the source or destination superusers.


## Options


 The following command-line options control the content and format of the output.

`-a`, `--data-only`
:   Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions) or statistics.

`-c`, `--clean`
:   Emit SQL commands to `DROP` all the dumped databases, roles, and tablespaces before recreating them. This option is useful when the restore is to overwrite an existing cluster. If any of the objects do not exist in the destination cluster, ignorable error messages will be reported during restore, unless `--if-exists` is also specified.

<code>-E </code><em>encoding</em>, <code>--encoding=</code><em>encoding</em>
:   Create the dump in the specified character set encoding. By default, the dump is created in the database encoding. (Another way to get the same result is to set the `PGCLIENTENCODING` environment variable to the desired dump encoding.)

<code>-f </code><em>filename</em>, <code>--file=</code><em>filename</em>
:   Send output to the specified file. If this is omitted, the standard output is used. This option can only be omitted when `--format` is plain.

<code>-F </code><em>format</em>, <code>--format=</code><em>format</em>
:   Specify the format of dump files. In plain format, all the dump data is sent in a single text stream. This is the default. In all other modes, pg_dumpall first creates two files, `toc.glo` and `map.dat`, in the directory specified by `--file`. The first file contains global data (roles and tablespaces) in custom format. The second contains a mapping between database OIDs and names. These files are used by pg_restore. Data for individual databases is placed in the `databases` subdirectory, named using the database's OID.

    `d`, `directory`
    :   Output directory-format archives for each database, suitable for input into pg_restore. The directory will have database `oid` as its name.

    `p`, `plain`
    :   Output a plain-text SQL script file (the default).

    `c`, `custom`
    :   Output a custom-format archive for each database, suitable for input into pg_restore. The archive will be named `dboid.dmp` where `dboid` is the `oid` of the database.

    `t`, `tar`
    :   Output a tar-format archive for each database, suitable for input into pg_restore. The archive will be named `dboid.tar` where `dboid` is the `oid` of the database.
     See [app-pgdump](pg_dump.md#app-pgdump) for details on how the various non-plain-text archive formats work.

`-g`, `--globals-only`
:   Dump only global objects (roles and tablespaces), no databases. Note: `--globals-only` cannot be used with `--clean` with non-text dump format.

`-O`, `--no-owner`
:   Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the original database. By default, pg_dumpall issues `ALTER OWNER` or `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` statements to set ownership of created schema elements. These statements will fail when the script is run unless it is started by a superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script). To make a script that can be restored by any user, but will give that user ownership of all the objects, specify `-O`.

`-r`, `--roles-only`
:   Dump only roles, no databases or tablespaces.

`-s`, `--schema-only`
:   Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data.

<code>-S </code><em>username</em>, <code>--superuser=</code><em>username</em>
:   Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling triggers. This is relevant only if `--disable-triggers` is used. (Usually, it's better to leave this out, and instead start the resulting script as superuser.)

`-t`, `--tablespaces-only`
:   Dump only tablespaces, no databases or roles.

`-v`, `--verbose`
:   Specifies verbose mode. This will cause pg_dumpall to output start/stop times to the dump file, and progress messages to standard error. Repeating the option causes additional debug-level messages to appear on standard error. The option is also passed down to pg_dump.

`-V`, `--version`
:   Print the pg_dumpall version and exit.

`-x`, `--no-privileges`, `--no-acl`
:   Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke commands).

`--binary-upgrade`
:   This option is for use by in-place upgrade utilities. Its use for other purposes is not recommended or supported. The behavior of the option may change in future releases without notice.

`--column-inserts`, `--attribute-inserts`
:   Dump data as `INSERT` commands with explicit column names (<code>INSERT INTO
            </code><em>table</em><code>
            (</code><em>column</em><code>, ...) VALUES
            ...</code>). This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL databases.

`--disable-dollar-quoting`
:   This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function bodies, and forces them to be quoted using SQL standard string syntax.

`--disable-triggers`
:   This option is relevant only when creating a dump with data and without schema. It instructs pg_dumpall to include commands to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while the data is restored. Use this if you have referential integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you do not want to invoke during data restore.


     Presently, the commands emitted for `--disable-triggers` must be done as superuser. So, you should also specify a superuser name with `-S`, or preferably be careful to start the resulting script as a superuser.

<code>--exclude-database=</code><em>pattern</em>
:   Do not dump databases whose name matches *pattern*. Multiple patterns can be excluded by writing multiple `--exclude-database` switches. The *pattern* parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by psql's `\d` commands (see [Patterns](psql.md#app-psql-patterns)), so multiple databases can also be excluded by writing wildcard characters in the pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent shell wildcard expansion.

<code>--extra-float-digits=</code><em>ndigits</em>
:   Use the specified value of extra_float_digits when dumping floating-point data, instead of the maximum available precision. Routine dumps made for backup purposes should not use this option.

<code>--filter=</code><em>filename</em>
:   Specify a filename from which to read patterns for databases excluded from the dump. The patterns are interpreted according to the same rules as `--exclude-database`. To read from `STDIN`, use `-` as the filename. The `--filter` option can be specified in conjunction with `--exclude-database` for excluding databases, and can also be specified more than once for multiple filter files.


     The file lists one database pattern per row, with the following format:

    ```

    exclude database PATTERN
    ```


     Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and ignored. Comments can be placed after an object pattern row as well. Blank lines are also ignored. See [Patterns](psql.md#app-psql-patterns) for how to perform quoting in patterns.

`--if-exists`
:   Use `DROP ... IF EXISTS` commands to drop objects in `--clean` mode. This suppresses “does not exist” errors that might otherwise be reported. This option is not valid unless `--clean` is also specified.

`--inserts`
:   Dump data as `INSERT` commands (rather than `COPY`). This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL databases. Note that the restore might fail altogether if you have rearranged column order. The `--column-inserts` option is safer, though even slower.

`--load-via-partition-root`
:   When dumping data for a table partition, make the `COPY` or `INSERT` statements target the root of the partitioning hierarchy that contains it, rather than the partition itself. This causes the appropriate partition to be re-determined for each row when the data is loaded. This may be useful when restoring data on a server where rows do not always fall into the same partitions as they did on the original server. That could happen, for example, if the partitioning column is of type text and the two systems have different definitions of the collation used to sort the partitioning column.

<code>--lock-wait-timeout=</code><em>timeout</em>
:   Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of the dump. Instead, fail if unable to lock a table within the specified *timeout*. The timeout may be specified in any of the formats accepted by `SET statement_timeout`.

`--no-comments`
:   Do not dump `COMMENT` commands.

`--no-data`
:   Do not dump data.

`--no-policies`
:   Do not dump row security policies.

`--no-publications`
:   Do not dump publications.

`--no-role-passwords`
:   Do not dump passwords for roles. When restored, roles will have a null password, and password authentication will always fail until the password is set. Since password values aren't needed when this option is specified, the role information is read from the catalog view `pg_roles` instead of `pg_authid`. Therefore, this option also helps if access to `pg_authid` is restricted by some security policy.

`--no-schema`
:   Do not dump schema (data definitions).

`--no-security-labels`
:   Do not dump security labels.

`--no-statistics`
:   Do not dump statistics. This is the default.

`--no-subscriptions`
:   Do not dump subscriptions.

`--no-sync`
:   By default, `pg_dumpall` will wait for all files to be written safely to disk. This option causes `pg_dumpall` to return without waiting, which is faster, but means that a subsequent operating system crash can leave the dump corrupt. Generally, this option is useful for testing but should not be used when dumping data from production installation.

`--no-table-access-method`
:   Do not output commands to select table access methods. With this option, all objects will be created with whichever table access method is the default during restore.

`--no-tablespaces`
:   Do not output commands to create tablespaces nor select tablespaces for objects. With this option, all objects will be created in whichever tablespace is the default during restore.

`--no-toast-compression`
:   Do not output commands to set TOAST compression methods. With this option, all columns will be restored with the default compression setting.

`--no-unlogged-table-data`
:   Do not dump the contents of unlogged tables. This option has no effect on whether or not the table definitions (schema) are dumped; it only suppresses dumping the table data.

`--on-conflict-do-nothing`
:   Add `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to `INSERT` commands. This option is not valid unless `--inserts` or `--column-inserts` is also specified.

`--quote-all-identifiers`
:   Force quoting of all identifiers. This option is recommended when dumping a database from a server whose PostgreSQL major version is different from pg_dumpall's, or when the output is intended to be loaded into a server of a different major version. By default, pg_dumpall quotes only identifiers that are reserved words in its own major version. This sometimes results in compatibility issues when dealing with servers of other versions that may have slightly different sets of reserved words. Using `--quote-all-identifiers` prevents such issues, at the price of a harder-to-read dump script.

<code>--restrict-key=</code><em>restrict_key</em>
:   Use the provided string as the psql `\restrict` key in the dump output. If no restrict key is specified, pg_dumpall will generate a random one as needed. Keys may contain only alphanumeric characters.


     This option is primarily intended for testing purposes and other scenarios that require repeatable output (e.g., comparing dump files). It is not recommended for general use, as a malicious server with advance knowledge of the key may be able to inject arbitrary code that will be executed on the machine that runs psql with the dump output.

<code>--rows-per-insert=</code><em>nrows</em>
:   Dump data as `INSERT` commands (rather than `COPY`). Controls the maximum number of rows per `INSERT` command. The value specified must be a number greater than zero. Any error during restoring will cause only rows that are part of the problematic `INSERT` to be lost, rather than the entire table contents.

`--statistics`
:   Dump optimizer statistics.

`--statistics-only`
:   Dump only the statistics, not the schema (data definitions) or data. Optimizer statistics for tables, materialized views, foreign tables, and indexes are dumped.

`--sequence-data`
:   Include sequence data in the dump. This is the default behavior except when `--no-data`, `--schema-only`, or `--statistics-only` is specified.

`--use-set-session-authorization`
:   Output SQL-standard `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` commands instead of `ALTER OWNER` commands to determine object ownership. This makes the dump more standards compatible, but depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might not restore properly.

`-?`, `--help`
:   Show help about pg_dumpall command line arguments, and exit.


 The following command-line options control the database connection parameters.

<code>-d </code><em>connstr</em>, <code>--dbname=</code><em>connstr</em>
:   Specifies parameters used to connect to the server, as a [connection string](../../client-interfaces/libpq-c-library/database-connection-control-functions.md#libpq-connstring); these will override any conflicting command line options.


     The option is called `--dbname` for consistency with other client applications, but because pg_dumpall needs to connect to many databases, the database name in the connection string will be ignored. Use the `-l` option to specify the name of the database used for the initial connection, which will dump global objects and discover what other databases should be dumped.

<code>-h </code><em>host</em>, <code>--host=</code><em>host</em>
:   Specifies the host name of the machine on which the database server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default is taken from the `PGHOST` environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.

<code>-l </code><em>dbname</em>, <code>--database=</code><em>dbname</em>
:   Specifies the name of the database to connect to for dumping global objects and discovering what other databases should be dumped. If not specified, the `postgres` database will be used, and if that does not exist, `template1` will be used.

<code>-p </code><em>port</em>, <code>--port=</code><em>port</em>
:   Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections. Defaults to the `PGPORT` environment variable, if set, or a compiled-in default.

<code>-U </code><em>username</em>, <code>--username=</code><em>username</em>
:   User name to connect as.

`-w`, `--no-password`
:   Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a `.pgpass` file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password.

`-W`, `--password`
:   Force pg_dumpall to prompt for a password before connecting to a database.


     This option is never essential, since pg_dumpall will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication. However, pg_dumpall will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing `-W` to avoid the extra connection attempt.


     Note that the password prompt will occur again for each database to be dumped. Usually, it's better to set up a `~/.pgpass` file than to rely on manual password entry.

<code>--role=</code><em>rolename</em>
:   Specifies a role name to be used to create the dump. This option causes pg_dumpall to issue a `SET ROLE` *rolename* command after connecting to the database. It is useful when the authenticated user (specified by `-U`) lacks privileges needed by pg_dumpall, but can switch to a role with the required rights. Some installations have a policy against logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this option allows dumps to be made without violating the policy.


## Environment


`PGHOST`, `PGOPTIONS`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`
:   Default connection parameters

`PG_COLOR`
:   Specifies whether to use color in diagnostic messages. Possible values are `always`, `auto` and `never`.


 This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by libpq (see [Environment Variables](../../client-interfaces/libpq-c-library/environment-variables.md#libpq-envars)).


## Notes


 Since pg_dumpall calls pg_dump internally, some diagnostic messages will refer to pg_dump.


 The `--clean` option can be useful even when your intention is to restore the dump script into a fresh cluster. Use of `--clean` authorizes the script to drop and re-create the built-in `postgres` and `template1` databases, ensuring that those databases will retain the same properties (for instance, locale and encoding) that they had in the source cluster. Without the option, those databases will retain their existing database-level properties, as well as any pre-existing contents.


 When `--statistics` is specified, `pg_dumpall` will include most optimizer statistics in the resulting dump file. This does not include all statistics, such as those created explicitly with [sql-createstatistics](../sql-commands/create-statistics.md#sql-createstatistics), custom statistics added by an extension, or statistics collected by the cumulative statistics system. Therefore, it may still be useful to run `ANALYZE` on each database after restoring from a dump file to ensure optimal performance. You can also run `vacuumdb -a -z` to analyze all databases.


 The dump script should not be expected to run completely without errors. In particular, because the script will issue `CREATE ROLE` for every role existing in the source cluster, it is certain to get a “role already exists” error for the bootstrap superuser, unless the destination cluster was initialized with a different bootstrap superuser name. This error is harmless and should be ignored. Use of the `--clean` option is likely to produce additional harmless error messages about non-existent objects, although you can minimize those by adding `--if-exists`.


 pg_dumpall requires all needed tablespace directories to exist before the restore; otherwise, database creation will fail for databases in non-default locations.


 It is generally recommended to use the `-X` (`--no-psqlrc`) option when restoring a database from a pg_dumpall script to ensure a clean restore process and prevent potential conflicts with non-default psql configurations. Additionally, because the pg_dumpall script may include psql meta-commands, it may be incompatible with clients other than psql.

## Examples


 To dump all databases in plain text format (the default):

```

$ pg_dumpall > db.out
```


 To dump all databases using other formats:

```

$ pg_dumpall --format=directory -f db.out
$ pg_dumpall --format=custom -f db.out
$ pg_dumpall --format=tar -f db.out
```


 To restore database(s) from this file, you can use:

```

$ psql -X -f db.out -d postgres
```
 It is not important which database you connect to here since the script file created by pg_dumpall will contain the appropriate commands to create and connect to the saved databases. An exception is that if you specified `--clean`, you must connect to the `postgres` database initially; the script will attempt to drop other databases immediately, and that will fail for the database you are connected to.


 If the dump was taken in a non-plain-text format, use pg_restore to restore the databases:

```

$ pg_restore db.out -d postgres -C
```
 This will restore all databases. To restore only some databases, use the `--exclude-database` option to skip those not wanted.
