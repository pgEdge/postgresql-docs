# &&

Returns `TRUE` if A's 2D bounding box intersects B's 2D bounding box.

## Synopsis


```sql
boolean &&(geometry

				  A, geometry

				  B)
boolean &&(geography

				  A, geography

				  B)
```


## Description


The `&&` operator returns `TRUE` if the 2D bounding box of geometry A intersects the 2D bounding box of geometry B.

Enhanced: 2.0.0 support for Polyhedral surfaces was introduced.


Availability: 1.5.0 support for geography was introduced.

# =

Returns `TRUE` if the coordinates and coordinate order geometry/geography A are the same as the coordinates and coordinate order of geometry/geography B.

## Synopsis


```sql
boolean =(geometry

				  A, geometry

				  B)
boolean =(geography

					  A, geography

					  B)
```


## Description


The `=` operator returns `TRUE` if the coordinates and coordinate order geometry/geography A are the same as the coordinates and coordinate order of geometry/geography B. PostgreSQL uses the =, <, and > operators defined for geometries to perform internal orderings and comparison of geometries (ie. in a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause).


!!! note

    Only geometry/geography that are exactly equal in all respects, with the same coordinates, in the same order, are considered equal by this operator. For "spatial equality", that ignores things like coordinate order, and can detect features that cover the same spatial area with different representations, use [ST_OrderingEquals](spatial-relationships.md#ST_OrderingEquals) or [ST_Equals](spatial-relationships.md#ST_Equals)


!!! caution

    This operand will NOT make use of any indexes that may be available on the geometries. For an index assisted exact equality test, combine = with &&.


Changed: 2.4.0, in prior versions this was bounding box equality not a geometric equality. If you need bounding box equality, use [ST_Geometry_Same](#ST_Geometry_Same) instead.

```sql

SELECT 'LINESTRING(0 0, 0 1, 1 0)'::geometry = 'LINESTRING(1 1, 0 0)'::geometry;

# @(box2df,box2df)

Returns `TRUE` if a 2D float precision bounding box (BOX2DF) is contained into another 2D float precision bounding box.

## Synopsis


```sql
boolean @(box2df

				  A, box2df

## Description


The `@` operator returns `TRUE` if the 2D bounding box A is contained into the 2D bounding box B, using float precision. This means that if A (or B) is a (double precision) box2d, it will be internally converted to a float precision 2D bounding box (BOX2DF)

Availability: 1.5.0 changed behavior


!!! warning

    This operator has changed behavior in PostGIS 1.5 from testing for actual geometric equality to only checking for bounding box equality. To complicate things it also depends on if you have done a hard or soft upgrade which behavior your database has. To find out which behavior your database has you can run the query below. To check for true equality use [ST_OrderingEquals](spatial-relationships.md#ST_OrderingEquals) or [ST_Equals](spatial-relationships.md#ST_Equals).


## Examples


```


select 'LINESTRING(0 0, 1 1)'::geometry ~= 'LINESTRING(0 1, 1 0)'::geometry as equality;
 equality   |
-----------------+
          t    |

## Distance Operators
  <a id="geometry_distance_knn"></a>

# <->

Returns the 2D distance between A and B.

## Synopsis


```sql
double precision <->(geometry

				  A, geometry

				  B)
double precision <->(geography

				  A, geography

				  B)
```


## Description


 The `<->` operator returns the 2D distance between two geometries. Used in the "ORDER BY" clause provides index-assisted nearest-neighbor result sets. For PostgreSQL below 9.5 only gives centroid distance of bounding boxes and for PostgreSQL 9.5+, does true KNN distance search giving true distance between geometries, and distance sphere for geographies.


!!! note

    This operand will make use of 2D GiST indexes that may be available on the geometries. It is different from other operators that use spatial indexes in that the spatial index is only used when the operator is in the ORDER BY clause.


!!! note

    Index only kicks in if one of the geometries is a constant (not in a subquery/cte). e.g. 'SRID=3005;POINT(1011102 450541)'::geometry instead of a.geom


Refer to [PostGIS workshop: Nearest-Neighbor Searching](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/knn.html) for a detailed example.


Enhanced: 2.2.0 -- True KNN ("K nearest neighbor") behavior for geometry and geography for PostgreSQL 9.5+. Note for geography KNN is based on sphere rather than spheroid. For PostgreSQL 9.4 and below, geography support is new but only supports centroid box.


Changed: 2.2.0 -- For PostgreSQL 9.5 users, old Hybrid syntax may be slower, so you'll want to get rid of that hack if you are running your code only on PostGIS 2.2+ 9.5+. See examples below.


Availability: 2.0.0 -- Weak KNN provides nearest neighbors based on geometry centroid distances instead of true distances. Exact results for points, inexact for all other types. Available for PostgreSQL 9.1+


## Examples


```sql
SELECT ST_Distance(geom, 'SRID=3005;POINT(1011102 450541)'::geometry) as d,edabbr, vaabbr
FROM va2005
ORDER BY d limit 10;

        d         | edabbr | vaabbr
------------------+--------+--------
                0 | ALQ    | 128
 5541.57712511724 | ALQ    | 129A
 5579.67450712005 | ALQ    | 001
  6083.4207708641 | ALQ    | 131
  7691.2205404848 | ALQ    | 003
 7900.75451037313 | ALQ    | 122
 8694.20710669982 | ALQ    | 129B
 9564.24289057111 | ALQ    | 130
  12089.665931705 | ALQ    | 127
 18472.5531479404 | ALQ    | 002
(10 rows)
```


 Then the KNN raw answer:


```sql

SELECT st_distance(geom, 'SRID=3005;POINT(1011102 450541)'::geometry) as d,edabbr, vaabbr
FROM va2005
ORDER BY geom <-> 'SRID=3005;POINT(1011102 450541)'::geometry limit 10;

        d         | edabbr | vaabbr
------------------+--------+--------
                0 | ALQ    | 128
 5541.57712511724 | ALQ    | 129A
 5579.67450712005 | ALQ    | 001
  6083.4207708641 | ALQ    | 131
  7691.2205404848 | ALQ    | 003
 7900.75451037313 | ALQ    | 122
 8694.20710669982 | ALQ    | 129B
 9564.24289057111 | ALQ    | 130
  12089.665931705 | ALQ    | 127
 18472.5531479404 | ALQ    | 002
(10 rows)
```


 If you run "EXPLAIN ANALYZE" on the two queries you would see a performance improvement for the second.


 For users running with PostgreSQL < 9.5, use a hybrid query to find the true nearest neighbors. First a CTE query using the index-assisted KNN, then an exact query to get correct ordering:


```sql

WITH index_query AS (
  SELECT ST_Distance(geom, 'SRID=3005;POINT(1011102 450541)'::geometry) as d,edabbr, vaabbr
	FROM va2005
  ORDER BY geom <-> 'SRID=3005;POINT(1011102 450541)'::geometry LIMIT 100)
  SELECT *
	FROM index_query
  ORDER BY d limit 10;

        d         | edabbr | vaabbr
------------------+--------+--------
                0 | ALQ    | 128
 5541.57712511724 | ALQ    | 129A

# |=|

Returns the distance between A and B trajectories at their closest point of approach.

## Synopsis


```sql
double precision |=|(geometry

				  A, geometry

```


## Description


 The `|=|` operator returns the 3D distance between two trajectories (See [ST_IsValidTrajectory](trajectory-functions.md#ST_IsValidTrajectory)). This is the same as [ST_DistanceCPA](trajectory-functions.md#ST_DistanceCPA) but as an operator it can be used for doing nearest neighbor searches using an N-dimensional index (requires PostgreSQL 9.5.0 or higher).


!!! note

    This operand will make use of ND GiST indexes that may be available on the geometries. It is different from other operators that use spatial indexes in that the spatial index is only used when the operator is in the ORDER BY clause.


!!! note

    Index only kicks in if one of the geometries is a constant (not in a subquery/cte). e.g. 'SRID=3005;LINESTRINGM(0 0 0,0 0 1)'::geometry instead of a.geom


Availability: 2.2.0. Index-supported only available for PostgreSQL 9.5+

# <#>

Returns the 2D distance between A and B bounding boxes.

## Synopsis


```sql

## Description


The `<#>` operator returns distance between two floating point bounding boxes, possibly reading them from a spatial index (PostgreSQL 9.1+ required). Useful for doing nearest neighbor **approximate** distance ordering.
