# Troubleshooting

### Why isn’t a query using an index?

The query needs to have an `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, and the `ORDER BY` must be the result of a distance operator (not an expression) in ascending order.

```sql
-- index
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;

-- no index
ORDER BY 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') DESC LIMIT 5;
```

You can encourage the planner to use an index for a query with:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL enable_seqscan = off;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

Also, if the table is small, a table scan may be faster.

### Why isn’t a query using a parallel table scan?

The planner doesn’t consider [out-of-line storage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) in cost estimates, which can make a serial scan look cheaper. You can reduce the cost of a parallel scan for a query with:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL min_parallel_table_scan_size = 1;
SET LOCAL parallel_setup_cost = 1;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

or choose to store vectors inline:

```sql
ALTER TABLE items ALTER COLUMN embedding SET STORAGE PLAIN;
```

### Why are there less results for a query after adding an HNSW index?

Results are limited by the size of the dynamic candidate list (`hnsw.ef_search`). There may be even less results due to dead tuples or filtering conditions in the query. We recommend setting `hnsw.ef_search` to at least twice the `LIMIT` of the query. If you need more than 500 results, use an IVFFlat index instead.

Also, note that `NULL` vectors are not indexed (as well as zero vectors for cosine distance).

### Why are there less results for a query after adding an IVFFlat index?

The index was likely created with too little data for the number of lists. Drop the index until the table has more data.

```sql
DROP INDEX index_name;
```

Results can also be limited by the number of probes (`ivfflat.probes`).

Also, note that `NULL` vectors are not indexed (as well as zero vectors for cosine distance).
